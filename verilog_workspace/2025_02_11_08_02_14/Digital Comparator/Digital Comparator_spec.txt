Description: A 4-bit digital comparator that compares two binary numbers and outputs their relationship (equal, greater than, less than).  

Inputs:  
- A: 4-bit binary number to be compared.  
- B: 4-bit binary number to be compared.  

Outputs:  
- E: 1-bit output indicating equality (A == B).  
- G: 1-bit output indicating greater than (A > B).  
- L: 1-bit output indicating less than (A < B).  

Functionality:  
The comparator performs a bitwise comparison of A and B. It starts from the most significant bit (MSB) and proceeds to the least significant bit (LSB). If all bits are equal, E is set to 1. Otherwise, G is set if A > B, and L is set if A < B.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock: clk (positive edge-sensitive clock).  
- Reset: rst (active-high synchronous reset).  
- Critical path delay: <= 10 ns for a 100 MHz clock.
