Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I recall that a multiplexer selects between multiple inputs based on a control signal. For a 4-to-1 MUX, there are four data inputs and two control signals (since 2^2 = 4). The output is determined by the combination of these control signals.

I'll start by defining the module with the correct ports. The specifications mention four data inputs (in0 to in3), two control inputs (sel0 and sel1), and one output (out). All these should be `input wire [7:0]` as they are likely 8-bit signals.

Next, I need to structure the logic. The selection is based on the combination of sel0 and sel1. There are four possible combinations:
- sel0=0, sel1=0 → select in0
- sel0=0, sel1=1 → select in1
- sel0=1, sel1=0 → select in2
- sel0=1, sel1=1 → select in3

I can use a case statement to handle each combination. Alternatively, I could use a series of if-else statements, but a case statement is more efficient and readable for multiple conditions.

In the code, I'll assign the output based on the selected input using a case statement. This ensures that all possible control combinations are covered and the correct data input is passed to the output.

I should also consider the data width. Since all inputs and outputs are 8 bits wide, the assignment will handle each byte correctly without additional logic.

Finally, I'll include clear comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code, making it easier for others to understand.

```verilog
module mux_4to1 (
    input wire [7:0] in0,
    input wire [7:0] in1,
    input wire [7:0] in2,
    input wire [7:0] in3,
    input wire sel0,
    input wire sel1,
    output wire [7:0] out
);

    // This module selects between four 8-bit inputs based on two control signals (sel0 and sel1).
    // The selection is determined as follows:
    // - sel0=0, sel1=0 → in0
    // - sel0=0, sel1=1 → in1
    // - sel0=1, sel1=0 → in2
    // - sel0=1, sel1=1 → in3
    case ({sel0, sel1}) {
        2'b00: out = in0;
        2'b01: out = in1;
        2'b10: out = in2;
        default: out = in3; // 2'b11: out = in3
    }

endmodule
```
