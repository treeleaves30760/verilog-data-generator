Alright, so I need to create a Verilog testbench for an HDMI transmitter module. The user has provided the specifications, including inputs, outputs, and functionality. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what the HDMI transmitter does. It takes video and audio data and encodes it into TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) streams for transmission over HDMI cables. The key here is that it's encoding RGB video data and audio data into these differential signals.

Looking at the inputs:
- `pixel_clock`: 120 MHz
- `reset_n`: Active low reset
- `rgb_data`: 24 bits (8 bits per color channel)
- `hsync` and `vsync`: Sync signals for horizontal and vertical synchronization
- `audio_data`: 16 bits

The outputs are the TMDS differential pairs (A, B, C, D) along with their clock signals.

Now, for the testbench, I need to:
1. Generate the pixel clock at 120 MHz.
2. Handle the reset signal properly.
3. Provide all possible combinations of input data.
4. Check that the outputs are correctly generated based on the inputs.

I should start by setting up the clocks and resets in the testbench. The pixel clock is straightforward—just toggle a wire every 5 nanoseconds to get 120 MHz. The TMDS clock runs at 270 MHz, so I'll need to generate that as well.

Next, I need to apply various inputs to the DUT (Device Under Test). For the RGB data, I can use random patterns or specific known values to test different scenarios. Similarly, I'll toggle the `hsync` and `vsync` signals to simulate a raster scan.

For the audio data, since it's 16 bits, I can generate random 16-bit words for testing.

Now, the tricky part is verifying the TMDS outputs. Since TMDS encoding involves converting RGB data into a serialized differential format, I need to ensure that the DUT correctly encodes and transmits this data.

I'll need to monitor the TMDS outputs and compare them against expected values. However, since TMDS encoding is complex, it might be challenging to manually verify each bit. Perhaps using automated checks or comparing the overall integrity of the transmitted data would be more practical.

Also, I should consider the timing aspects—ensuring that the DUT properly synchronizes the TMDS clock with the pixel clock and handles the reset correctly.

Finally, after setting up all the inputs and monitoring the outputs, I'll need to run the testbench and observe whether the DUT behaves as expected under various conditions. If any discrepancies are found, I can adjust the test cases or the DUT implementation accordingly.
