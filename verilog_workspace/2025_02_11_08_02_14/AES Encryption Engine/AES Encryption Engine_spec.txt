1. Module Name: aes_engine  
2. Description: High-speed AES encryption engine supporting 128/192/256-bit keys.  
3. Inputs:  
   - aes_key: 256-bit AES encryption key (128/192/256 bits)  
   - aes_input: 128-bit Plaintext input to be encrypted  
   - start: 1-bit Start signal to begin encryption process  
   - reset_n: 1-bit Asynchronous active-low reset signal  
   - clock: 1-bit System clock input  
4. Outputs:  
   - aes_output: 128-bit Ciphertext output after encryption  
   - aes_done: 1-bit Completion signal when encryption is complete  
5. Functionality:  
   The AES engine processes plaintext into ciphertext using the AES algorithm with support for 128/192/256-bit keys. It performs the following steps:  
   - Initialization on reset_n assertion.  
   - Waits for start signal to begin encryption.  
   - Encrypts the aes_input according to AES specifications, producing aes_output.  
   - Asserts aes_done when encryption completes.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock frequency: Up to 300 MHz  
   - Reset_n is asynchronous and halts all operations upon assertion.
