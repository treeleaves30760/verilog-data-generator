Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Frequency Multiplier. Hmm, let me think about what that entails.

First, I should understand what a frequency multiplier does. From what I remember, it's a circuit that takes an input clock signal and generates an output with a higher frequency, typically by multiplying the input frequency by an integer factor. Common multipliers are x2 or x4, but maybe this one is more general.

The user provided a sample specification for a 4x Frequency Multiplier. Let me look at that to get a sense of structure and details needed.

In their example, the module name was "frequency_multiplier," with inputs like clk (for clock), reset_n (active low reset), and mult_factor which is 2 bits wide. The output was multiplied_clk, same width as input.

Functionality: They described it as multiplying the input frequency by a factor specified by mult_factor, ensuring no setup/hold time violations, using flip-flops for synchronization.

Timing requirements included a clock period based on the multiplier and reset polarity.

So, to create my own, I should follow this structure but perhaps adjust some parameters or add more details.

I think I'll go with a 2x multiplier since it's simpler. Maybe make the mult_factor a 1-bit input for simplicityâ€”0 could be x1, 1 would be x2. That way, it's easy to implement and test.

Inputs:
- clk: probably 1 bit, but maybe specify the period? Or just leave it as is.
- reset_n: active low reset, so when it's 0, the circuit resets.
- mult_factor: 1 bit, 0 for x1, 1 for x2.

Outputs:
- multiplied_clk: same width as input clock, which is 1 bit.

Functionality: When mult_factor is 0, output same as input. When 1, double the frequency. Need to handle synchronization so that there are no timing issues when changing factors.

Timing requirements: Clock period would be based on the multiplier. For x2, the period would be half of the input clock's period. Reset is active low, so it should reset all counters or flip-flops when asserted.

Wait, but in their example, they used a 4x multiplier with a 2-bit factor. Maybe I can generalize more. Let me think about how to structure this.

I need to make sure that the module correctly handles different multipliers and ensures timing constraints are met. Also, considering metastability if the multiplier changes during clock transitions.

So, in my spec, I should outline all these points clearly.

Let me draft it:

1. Module Name: frequency_multiplier_2x
2. Description: A circuit that doubles the input clock frequency.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 1-bit, input clock signal.
   - reset_n: 1-bit, active low reset signal.
   - mult_factor: 1-bit, multiplier factor (0 for x1, 1 for x2).
4. Outputs:
   - multiplied_clk: 1-bit, output clock with doubled frequency when mult_factor is 1.
5. Functionality:
   The module takes an input clock and a multiplier factor. Based on the factor, it either passes the clock as is or doubles its frequency. It uses edge detection and flip-flops to ensure proper synchronization and avoid timing violations. When reset_n is low (active), all internal states are reset.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock:clk has a period of T, multiplied_clk will have a period of T/2 when mult_factor is 1.
   - Reset:reset_n is active low with a setup time of t Setup and hold time of t Hold relative to the clock.

Wait, but in their example, they specified the clock periods more concretely. Maybe I should do the same, like if the input is 100MHz, output would be 200MHz when multiplier is x2.

Also, considering that the multiplier can change dynamically, so the module needs to handle transitions smoothly without glitches.

I think I covered all necessary points. Now, structuring it as per their format.

```  
1. Module Name: frequency_multiplier_2x  
2. Description: A circuit that doubles the input clock frequency based on a multiplier factor.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit, input clock signal.  
   - reset_n: 1 bit, active low reset signal.  
   - mult_factor: 1 bit, multiplier factor (0 for x1, 1 for x2).  
4. Outputs:  
   - multiplied_clk: 1 bit, output clock with doubled frequency when mult_factor is 1.  
5. Functionality:  
   The module doubles the input clock frequency when mult_factor is high (1). It uses edge detection and flip-flops to ensure proper synchronization and avoid timing violations. When reset_n is low, all internal states are reset.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): Input clock with a period of T. Output multiplied_clk has a period of T/2 when mult_factor is 1.  
   - Reset (reset_n): Active low reset with setup time t_SETUP and hold time t_HOLD relative to the clock edge.
