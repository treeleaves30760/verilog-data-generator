Alright, the user provided another query about creating a Verilog testbench. They included specific instructions to wrap code in ```verilog blocks and avoid explanations.

I need to ensure I follow their guidelines precisely. First, I'll structure the response with the verilog block as specified. The testbench should include clock generation using an initial loop, iterate through all input combinations, and display success or failure messages without any extra text.

Since they didn't specify a particular module name or inputs/outputs, I'll use generic names like `your_module_name`, `a`, `b`, and `output`. I'll also include placeholders for expected results using a function call, which the user can replace with actual logic.

I should make sure the code is clean and adheres to their requirements. No explanations or additional textâ€”just the Verilog code as they asked.

```verilog
module tb_your_module_name();
    // Clock generation
    initial begin
        clock = 0;
        forever #1 clock = ~clock;
    end

    // Test all input combinations
    initial begin
        $display("Starting testbench for your_module_name...");
        
        for (a = 0; a < 2; a++) begin
            for (b = 0; b < 2; b++) begin
                #0.1;
                your_module_input_a = a;
                your_module_input_b = b;
                
                #1;
                if (your_module_output != expected_result(a, b)) begin
                    $display("Test failed: Inputs %d and %d", a, b);
                    $finish;
                end
            end
        end
        
        $display("All tests passed successfully!");
        $finish;
    end
endmodule
```
