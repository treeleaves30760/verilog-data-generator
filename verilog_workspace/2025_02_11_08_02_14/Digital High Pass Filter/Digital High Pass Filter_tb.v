I'll start by setting up the module structure. The testbench will have a clk generator with a 10ns period, as that's common for simulations. The rst signal is active-high, so I'll initialize it to 1 for a few clock cycles before releasing it.

Next, I need to generate test inputs. Since d_in is a 16-bit signed integer, I should cover various cases: positive, negative, zero, and both the limits of the 16-bit range. Using an iterative loop with i from -32768 to 32767 makes sense because that's the full range for a 16-bit signed integer.

I'll use $display to print each input value and wait one clock cycle after each iteration to ensure the DUT processes the sample correctly. After processing all samples, I'll display a success message; if any failure occurs during simulation (like unexpected output), I'll show an error.

I should also handle the reset properly. The rst signal will be high for two clock cycles to ensure all flip-flops are initialized before testing begins.

Finally, I need to compile the necessary files using $readmemh for any initialization if needed, but in this case, since it's a simple filter without memory, maybe it's not required. However, including it as a placeholder is good practice.

Putting it all together, the testbench will generate the clock, reset the DUT, iterate through all possible input values, and check each output for correctness.
