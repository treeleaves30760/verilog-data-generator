2. Description: A module that splits a single digital signal into multiple output channels based on control signals.  
3. Inputs:  
   - input_data: 1 bit [The digital signal to be split]  
   - channel_select: 2 bits [Control signal to determine the output channel (00, 01, 10, 11)]  
   - rst_n: 1 bit [Active low reset signal]  
4. Outputs:  
   - ch0: 1 bit [Output channel 0]  
   - ch1: 1 bit [Output channel 1]  
   - ch2: 1 bit [Output channel 2]  
   - ch3: 1 bit [Output channel 3]  
5. Functionality:  
   The module routes the input_data to one of four output channels based on the channel_select control signal. Only one output channel is active at any given time. If all select bits are 0, no channel will receive the input data.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk (input)  
   - Reset: rst_n (active low)  
   - Setup Time: 1 clock cycle before reset assertion  
   - Hold Time: 1 clock cycle after reset de-assertion
