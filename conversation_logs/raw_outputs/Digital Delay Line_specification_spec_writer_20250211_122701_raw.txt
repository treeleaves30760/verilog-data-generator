Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Delay Line based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user mentioned that I should act as a Verilog specification writer. So, my role is clear: provide structured and detailed specifications without any extra explanations or markdown. They want it in a specific format with sections like Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements.

Looking at their example response, they provided each section clearly. The Digital Delay Line module has an 8-bit input data bus, and the goal is to introduce a programmable delay between the input and output. I should include all necessary details for implementation, such as control signals for clock enable, reset, and load.

I need to make sure that the Inputs and Outputs are listed with their widths and descriptions. For functionality, it's important to explain how the module works step by stepâ€”synchronizing on the rising edge of the clock, loading the delay value, and shifting the data through a series of flip-flops to achieve the desired delay.

Timing requirements should specify the clock frequency, reset polarity, and any setup or hold times for inputs. The user emphasized including all necessary details, so I shouldn't overlook synchronization or metastability issues, especially if the input is asynchronous.

I also need to ensure that the specification is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary jargon but still providing enough detail for someone to implement it correctly in Verilog. Since they provided a code block example, I should follow that structure precisely without using markdown or code blocks beyond what's specified.

In summary, my approach will be:
1. Identify each section required by the user.
2. Gather all necessary details for each section based on the Digital Delay Line functionality.
3. Structure the information clearly and concisely in the specified format.
4. Ensure that all control signals and timing aspects are covered to facilitate correct implementation.

I should double-check that I'm not missing any inputs or outputs, and that the functionality is explained thoroughly enough for someone to understand how the delay is achieved through shifting. Also, making sure that the timing requirements align with typical digital circuit design practices will be crucial.

```  
1. Module Name: digital_delay_line  
2. Description: A programmable digital delay line that introduces a fixed or variable time delay between an input signal and its output.  
3. Inputs:  
   - data_in: 8 bits [Input data to be delayed]  
   - clk: 1 bit [System clock]  
   - rst_n: 1 bit [Active-low reset]  
   - delay_value: 4 bits [Programmable delay value (0 to 15 clock cycles)]  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: 8 bits [Delayed output data]  
5. Functionality:  
   - The module introduces a programmable delay between the input and output signals based on the delay_value control signal.  
   - The delay is implemented using a shift register with a length determined by the delay_value.  
   - The delay can be adjusted in real-time by changing the delay_value input.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz, non-inverted  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active-low reset with a minimum hold time of 3 clock cycles  
   - All inputs must be stable for at least one full clock cycle before any transitions to ensure proper synchronization.
