Alright, I need to create a Verilog testbench for the given 4-bit counter specifications. Let me go through each part carefully.

First, the counter has three inputs: `clk`, `rst`, and `en`. The output is `count`, which is a 4-bit binary number. The functionality is that it increments on each rising edge of `clk` when `en` is high. It resets to zero when `rst` is asserted, with specific setup and hold times.

I'll start by setting up the testbench structure. I know that in Verilog, testbenches typically include initial blocks for setup and always blocks for continuous processes like clock generation.

For the clock, I need a 50 MHz signal. Since simulators often run with a time unit of 1 ns, I can calculate the period as 20 ns (since 1 / 50e6 = 20e-6 seconds). So, the clock will toggle every 20 ns.

Next, I'll generate the `rst` signal. The reset is active-high and requires setup and hold times of one clock cycle each. That means I need to assert `rst` at least one full clock period before any other signals are applied. In the testbench, I can apply `rst` for a couple of cycles to cover this.

The `en` signal is straightforward; it's just a control input that can be toggled as needed.

For the test cases, I need to cover all possible input combinations. That includes when `rst` is active, when `en` is enabled or disabled, and different clock cycles. I should simulate scenarios where the counter resets, starts counting with `en` high, and stops when `en` goes low.

I'll use `$display` statements to show the current state of the signals and the count value at each significant time step. This will help in verifying if the counter behaves as expected.

I also need to include success and failure messages. Using `$info` for success and `$error` for failures makes sense. If any assertion fails, the testbench should stop and display an error message.

Now, putting it all together: I'll create a module `tb_counter` with initial blocks for each signal. The clock is generated in an always block that toggles every 20 ns. The `rst` is set high for two periods to ensure proper setup. Then, I'll step through different time points, changing `en` and checking the count value at each rising edge of `clk`.

I should also include assertions to check if the count increments correctly when `en` is high and resets properly when `rst` is asserted. If any assertion fails, the testbench will stop and report an error.

Finally, after all tests are run, I'll display a success message indicating that all tests passed.

    always begin
        clk = 0; #10ns;
        clk = 1; #10ns;
    end
    
    initial begin

        en = 0;
        #20ns rst = 0;

        end
        
        // Success message
        $info("All test cases passed successfully");
    end
    
    // Reset assertion
    initial begin
        #0ns assert(rst) else $error("Reset is not asserted at the beginning");
    end
    
    // Check enable functionality
    initial begin
        #40ns if(en != 1) $error("Enable signal was not set after reset");
    end
    
    // Check maximum count
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(count == 4'b1111 && !rst && !en) $error("Counter exceeded max value without reset/enable");
    end
    
    // Check increment behavior
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if(en && count != (count + 1)) $error("Counter failed to increment when enabled");
    end
endmodule
