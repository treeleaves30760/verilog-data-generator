Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Encoder based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of how they want the specification structured. It includes Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. They also mentioned not to use markdown or code blocks and to keep it clear without extra explanations.

I should start by understanding what a Digital Signal Encoder does. Typically, it converts parallel data into a serial bitstream with synchronization bits. So the module needs to handle multiple inputs, add headers, footers, and maybe some error checking.

Looking at the example they gave, the module is named digital_signal_encoder with 8 inputs (data_bits) each being 1-bit wide. The outputs include clock, encoded_data, and a reset signal. The functionality involves time division of the input clock to generate a slower clock for encoding, adding sync headers and footers, and checking parity bits.

I need to make sure all these elements are included in my specification. I'll structure it step by step as per their format. For Inputs, I'll list each data bit with its width and description. Similarly, for Outputs, I'll include clock, encoded_data (with a higher width since it's serial), and reset.

In the Functionality section, I should explain how the module operates: time division, adding sync bits, checking parity, and handling errors. For Timing Requirements, I'll specify the input clock frequency, reset polarity, and timing for data synchronization.

I need to ensure that each part is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary details. Also, since they mentioned not using markdown or code blocks, I'll present it in plain text with proper line breaks as shown in their example.

Wait, the user also asked to put the spec inside a ``` code block, but without markdown. Hmm, maybe they just want it formatted clearly. So I'll follow their structure precisely, making sure each section is labeled correctly and all necessary details are included for implementation purposes.

I think that's about it. Let me compile this into the required format now.

```  
1. Module Name: digital_signal_encoder  
2. Description: A module that encodes parallel digital signals into a serial bitstream with synchronization headers and footers.  
3. Inputs:  
   - data_bits[7:0]: 1-bit Each input data bit to be encoded.  
   - clk: 1-bit System clock input.  
   - reset_n: 1-bit Active-low reset signal.  
4. Outputs:  
   - output_clk: 1-bit Encoded clock signal for synchronization.  
   - encoded_data: 8-bit Serial encoded output bitstream.  
   - sync_done: 1-bit Indicates completion of synchronization.  
5. Functionality:  
   - The module converts parallel data into a serial bitstream.  
   - Adds synchronization headers and footers to the encoded data.  
   - Implements parity checking for error detection.  
   - Generates a clock signal (output_clk) that is time-divided from the input clock (clk).  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Input clock (clk): 100 MHz  
   - Reset polarity: Active-low (reset_n)  
   - Synchronization timing: 10 cycles of output_clk for header/footer addition.
