Next, they specified that I should provide ONLY the Verilog code. So, no explanations or additional text¡Xjust the code itself. This makes sense because they probably want to paste this code directly into their testbench file without any extra information getting in the way.

They also mentioned including clock generation. In digital circuits, a clock is essential for timing and synchronization. I'll need to create a clock signal that alternates between high and low states at regular intervals. The example provided uses a period of 10 units, which seems reasonable for simulation purposes.

Testing all input combinations is another key point. This means that the testbench should apply every possible combination of inputs to the module under test. For example, if the module has two input bits, there are four possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), and the testbench should cover all of them. Using nested loops is a common way to achieve this in Verilog.

Including clear success/failure messages is important for verifying whether the module behaves as expected. The user wants $display statements that show whether each test case passed or failed. This helps in quickly identifying any issues during simulation.

I also noticed that the user emphasized NEVER adding explanations or asking questions. So, I need to make sure my final answer strictly adheres to this by providing only the code without any additional commentary or instructions.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the testbench with:
1. Clock generation using a forever loop and #5 time units for a 10ns period.
2. Initialization of input signals.
3. Nested loops to iterate through all possible input combinations.
4. $display statements to show each test case and its outcome (PASS/FAIL).
5. A final $test$finish statement to conclude the simulation.

I think this approach covers all the user's requirements effectively. Now, I'll write the Verilog code accordingly, ensuring it's clean and adheres to their formatting preferences.
