Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a USB controller. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should understand what a USB controller does. From what I know, it's responsible for handling communication between a device and a host, like a computer or another controller.

Alright, the user provided a detailed example of how to structure the specification. Let me look at that again. It had sections like Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. I need to follow that format but make sure all the details are accurate for a USB controller.

Starting with the Module Name: Probably something like usb_controller. That seems straightforward.

Description: I should briefly explain what it does. Maybe something like "A high-speed USB 2.0 controller module designed for full-speed device communication." That sounds good.

Inputs: Now, I need to list all the necessary inputs. Let's think about what a USB controller would receive. There's usually a clock signal (like clk), a reset button (rst), and data lines. For USB, there are D+ and D- lines which are differential signals. Also, VBUS is important for power. So I'll list these with their widths. Clocks are typically 1-bit, same with rst. D+ and D- might be single bits too, but sometimes they could have more depending on the implementation.

Outputs: Similarly, the controller will drive data out. OE (output enable), D+, D-, and maybe a status output like connected or something else. I'll need to define each with their widths.

Functionality: This is where it gets detailed. The USB controller needs to handle enumeration, which means initializing communication with the host. It also has to manage data transfer in both directions—bulk, interrupt, and control transfers. Isochronous transfers are for time-sensitive data like audio or video. I should mention that it supports high-speed operation, which is 480 Mbps.

I need to include how it handles USB packets: detecting start, processing tokens, handling data packets with CRC checks, and generating ACK/NACK responses. Also, error detection is crucial—things like bit stuffing errors, CRC mismatches, and timeouts should be part of the functionality.

Timing Requirements: This section should cover clocking, reset requirements, and any specific timing details. The USB 2.0 specification has strict timing rules, so the controller must adhere to those for proper operation. I'll note that it operates at 48 MHz for high-speed mode and that resets are asynchronous.

Wait, in the example provided, the user included a lot of specifics like SIE (Serial Interface Engine), FIFOs, endpoint management, etc. Maybe I should include similar details but tailored to the USB controller's functionality.

I also need to make sure each input and output is clearly defined with their widths. For instance, data_out might be 8 bits for byte transfers, and status signals are single bits.

Let me structure this step by step:

1. Module Name: usb_controller
2. Description: A brief but informative description.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal.
   - rst: 1-bit reset signal.
   - data_in: Depending on the protocol, maybe a stream of bits, perhaps with specific widths for different transfers.
   - D_: 1-bit differential data line (maybe as input and output? Or is it bidirectional?)
4. Outputs:
   - data_out: Driven by the controller to send data back.
   - status: Indicates connection or operation status.
5. Functionality: Enumerate all operations—enumeration, data transfer types, packet handling, error detection, etc.
6. Timing Requirements: Clocking details and reset conditions.

Wait, in the example given earlier, the user included more detailed inputs like d_p, d_n, vbus, and outputs like data_out, status, etc. Maybe I should mirror that structure but ensure it's accurate for a USB controller.

I think I have a good outline now. Let me put it all together following the specified format without any markdown or code blocks.

Here is the structured specification for the USB Controller in Verilog:

1. **Module Name:** usb_controller  
2. **Description:** A high-speed USB 2.0 controller module designed for full-speed device communication, handling data transfer and protocol management.  
3. **Inputs:**  
   - `clk`: 1 bit, System clock input.  
   - `rst`: 1 bit, Active-high reset signal.  
   - `d_p`: 1 bit, USB differential data plus line (input).  
   - `d_n`: 1 bit, USB differential data minus line (input).  
   - `vbus`: 1 bit, USB power bus detection input.  
4. **Outputs:**  
   - `data_out`: 8 bits, Data output to the connected device or host.  
   - `status`: 2 bits, Status indicators including enumeration complete and connection status.  
5. **Functionality:**  
   The USB controller manages communication between a device and a host, supporting high-speed (480 Mbps) operation. It handles USB 2.0 protocols, including:  
   - Enumeration process for initial setup.  
   - Data transfer operations (bulk, interrupt, control, isochronous).  
   - Packet handling with start detection, token processing, and data packet management.  
   - Error detection and recovery mechanisms for bit-stuffing errors, CRC mismatches, and timeouts.  
6. **Timing Requirements:**  
   - Operates on a 48 MHz clock for high-speed mode.  
   - Reset signal (`rst`) is asynchronous, active-high.  

This specification provides the necessary details for implementing a USB controller in Verilog, ensuring compliance with USB 2.0 standards and proper functionality.
