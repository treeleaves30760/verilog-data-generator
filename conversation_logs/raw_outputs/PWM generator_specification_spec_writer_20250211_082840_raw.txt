Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a PWM generator based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of how they want the specification formatted. They mentioned using sections like Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. So I should follow that structure closely.

The user is a Verilog specification writer, so they likely need something comprehensive for implementation. They emphasized including all necessary details without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text within a code block.

I'll start with the Module Name, probably naming it pwm_generator. The description should be brief but informative, stating that it's a high-resolution PWM generator supporting multiple channels.

Next, I need to list the inputs and outputs clearly. For inputs, I can include things like clock, reset, enable, channel selection, duty cycle control, and external sync signals. Each input should have its width and description.

Outputs will likely be the actual PWM signals for each channel, along with a status flag indicating if the generator is busy processing updates.

In the functionality section, I'll describe how the module works: generating PWM signals based on the selected channel, adjusting duty cycle, handling synchronization, and ensuring glitch-free transitions. It's important to mention that it supports multiple channels and provides feedback on whether an update is in progress.

For timing requirements, I should specify the clock frequency, reset polarity (probably active high), setup and hold times for inputs, pulse width resolution, and propagation delays. This gives clear guidelines for implementation and testing.

I also need to make sure each section is concise but thorough, avoiding any unnecessary explanations since the user wants only the specification.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each part as per the example, ensuring clarity and completeness so that someone can directly use this spec for Verilog coding without confusion.

```  
1. Module Name: pwm_generator  
2. Description: High-resolution pulse-width modulation (PWM) generator supporting multiple output channels with adjustable duty cycle and frequency control.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit [System clock input]  
   - rst_n: 1 bit [Active low reset signal]  
   - enable: 1 bit [Enable PWM generation]  
   - channel_sel: log2(N_CHANNELS) bits [Select the output channel (0 to N-1)]  
   - duty_cycle: $duty_width bits [$DUTY_WIDTH-bit duty cycle control (0 to 100%)]  
   - sync_in: 1 bit [External synchronization input]  
4. Outputs:  
   - pwm_out: 1 bit [PWM output signal for selected channel]  
   - busy: 1 bit [Indicates if an update is in progress]  
5. Functionality:  
   - Generates PWM signals for multiple channels based on the selected duty cycle and frequency.  
   - Supports external synchronization via sync_in input.  
   - Adjusts duty cycle dynamically while minimizing glitch-free transitions during updates.  
   - Provides busy flag to indicate ongoing configuration changes.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 100MHz (user-defined)  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active low, asynchronous reset with hold time >= 2 clock cycles.  
   - Setup time for inputs: 1 clock cycle before clk rising edge.  
   - Hold time for inputs: 1 clock cycle after clk falling edge.  
   - Pulse width resolution: 1ns (based on clock frequency).  
   - Propagation delay from input to output: <= 2 clock cycles.
