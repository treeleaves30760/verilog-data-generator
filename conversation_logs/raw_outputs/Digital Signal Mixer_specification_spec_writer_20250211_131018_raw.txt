Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Mixer based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for.

The user provided an example of how they want the specification structured, so I should follow that format closely. They mentioned including module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. Plus, they specified not to use markdown or code blocks beyond the initial response.

First, I'll think about what a Digital Signal Mixer does. It's used in audio processing to combine multiple input signals into one output, typically with adjustable levels for each input. So, the key functionalities would involve summing the inputs scaled by their respective gains and handling potential overflow.

Looking at the example given, it has 8 inputs (IN0 to IN7), each being a signed 16-bit integer. The outputs are similar but only one (OUT) with an overflow flag. That makes sense for a mixer as it can handle multiple channels.

For the functionality section, I need to describe how each input is multiplied by its corresponding gain factor and then summed. Also, checking if the result overflows the 16-bit signed integer range is crucial to set the overflow flag correctly.

Timing requirements are important too. The example mentions a clock (clk) with no specific frequency, a reset signal (rst), and that operations are synchronous on the falling edge of clk. I should include similar details but ensure they're clear and necessary.

I also need to make sure all inputs and outputs are clearly listed with their widths and descriptions. Each input has a corresponding gain control, which adds more signals to list.

Wait, in the example, there's no mention of how the gains are set or if they're fixed. Maybe I should assume they're fixed for simplicity unless specified otherwise. That way, the spec remains clear without extra complexity.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section step by step, ensuring clarity and completeness. I need to avoid any unnecessary explanations since the user wants only the specification without additional text.

```  
1. Module Name: digital_signal_mixer  
2. Description: A digital signal mixer that combines multiple input signals with adjustable gain levels into a single output signal.  
3. Inputs:  
   - IN0: 16 signed description: Input signal 0  
   - IN1: 16 signed description: Input signal 1  
   - IN2: 16 signed description: Input signal 2  
   - IN3: 16 signed description: Input signal 3  
   - IN4: 16 signed description: Input signal 4  
   - IN5: 16 signed description: Input signal 5  
   - IN6: 16 signed description: Input signal 6  
   - IN7: 16 signed description: Input signal 7  
   - GAIN0: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 0 (0-255)  
   - GAIN1: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 1 (0-255)  
   - GAIN2: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 2 (0-255)  
   - GAIN3: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 3 (0-255)  
   - GAIN4: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 4 (0-255)  
   - GAIN5: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 5 (0-255)  
   - GAIN6: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 6 (0-255)  
   - GAIN7: 8 unsigned description: Gain control for input 7 (0-255)  
4. Outputs:  
   - OUT: 16 signed description: Mixed output signal  
   - OVF: 1 unsigned description: Overflow flag (1 if overflow occurs, 0 otherwise)  
5. Functionality:  
   The mixer sums the products of each input signal and its corresponding gain control. The result is truncated to 16 bits. If the sum exceeds the 16-bit signed integer range (-32768 to 32767), the overflow flag (OVF) is set to 1.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk (no specified frequency)  
   - Reset: rst (active-high synchronous reset)  
   - Operations are performed synchronously on the falling edge of the clock signal.
