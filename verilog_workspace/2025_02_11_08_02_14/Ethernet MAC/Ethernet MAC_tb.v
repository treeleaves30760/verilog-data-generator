Looking at the inputs and outputs, I see several signals: clk, rst_n, rx_clk, rx_data, rx_valid, tx_en, tx_data, and various outputs like coll, tx_clk, etc. The functionality is quite extensive, including MAC layer protocols, collision detection, link management, and auto-negotiation.

I'll start by setting up the clock generation using a forever loop to toggle the clock signal every 4 units of time. Then, I'll initialize the reset signal and release it after a short delay.

Next, I need to test all possible input combinations for the receive data (rx_data) and other relevant inputs like rx_valid and tx_en. Since rx_data is 4 bits wide, there are 16 possible combinations. I'll use nested loops to iterate through all these possibilities.

For each combination, I'll apply the inputs and then wait for one clock cycle to allow the DUT (device under test) to process the signals. After that, I'll capture the outputs and verify if they match the expected behavior based on the current input conditions.

I'll include checks for collision detection when receiving valid data while transmitting is enabled or disabled. Additionally, I'll ensure that the link status, duplex mode, and auto-negotiation signals are correctly updated based on the input conditions.

Finally, after all test cases are completed, I'll display a summary to indicate whether all tests passed successfully.

I should make sure that the code is clean and well-organized, with comments where necessary for clarity, even though the user didn't ask for explanations. This will help anyone reading the testbench understand its structure.
