Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Phase Locked Loop (PLL). Hmm, where do I start? Well, I remember that a PLL is used to generate clock signals with specific frequencies and phase relationships. It's crucial in digital designs for synchronization.

First, the module name should be something clear like `pll_core`. That makes sense because it's the core of the PLL functionality.

Next, the description. I need to briefly explain what this module does. So, it's a digital PLL that locks onto an input clock and generates an output clock with a specific multiple of the input frequency. It should mention coarse and fine tuning for accuracy.

Now, the inputs. There are a few key signals here:

1. `clk_in`: This is the input clock. Its width is 1-bit, so it's just a single bit representing the clock signal.
2. `rst_n`: The reset signal, active low. Again, 1-bit.
3. `div_num`: This is the divider number input, which determines the division factor for the feedback path. It should be an N-bit bus because the user can set different divisors based on their needs.
4. `clk_out_enable`: A control signal to enable the output clock. 1-bit.

For the outputs:

1. `clk_out`: The output clock that's phase and frequency locked with `clk_in`. 1-bit.
2. `locked`: A status bit indicating whether the PLL has locked onto the input clock. 1-bit.

Moving on to functionality. I need to describe what this module does step by step. It should generate a stable output clock, adjust the phase using a charge pump and loop filter, and provide feedback for tuning. Also, it must handle reset conditions properly and indicate when it's locked.

Timing requirements are next. The module needs a clock (`clk_in`) with a specific frequency range, say 10 MHz to 500 MHz. The reset (`rst_n`) should be active low, so the user can reset the PLL by pulling this signal low. The `div_num` input is asynchronous, meaning it doesn't need a clock; it's just an input that changes when set. The `clk_out_enable` is also asynchronous.

I should note that the `locked` output becomes high only after the PLL has stabilized, which depends on the loop bandwidth and damping. Also, during reset, all outputs except for `rst_n` are undefined, so the user must handle that properly.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me think. Oh, right, the input frequencies and the division factor will affect the output frequency. The module should be able to handle a range of divisors, which is why `div_num` is an N-bit bus. Also, the loop filter parameters are important for stability but might be part of the implementation details rather than the specification.

I think that's all. I need to structure this clearly without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text with bullet points as specified.

1. Module Name: pll_core  
2. Description: A digital Phase Locked Loop (PLL) module that generates an output clock signal phase and frequency locked to the input clock signal. The PLL includes coarse and fine tuning stages for precise synchronization.  
3. Inputs:  
   - `clk_in`: 1-bit Input clock signal.  
   - `rst_n`: 1-bit Active low reset signal.  
   - `div_num`: N-bit Divider number input (user-defined divisor).  
   - `clk_out_enable`: 1-bit Control signal to enable the output clock generation.  
4. Outputs:  
   - `clk_out`: 1-bit Output clock signal, phase and frequency locked to `clk_in`.  
   - `locked`: 1-bit Status signal indicating PLL lock (high when locked).  
5. Functionality:  
   - Generates a stable output clock signal (`clk_out`) with the desired frequency multiple of `clk_in`.  
   - Implements a charge pump and loop filter for phase adjustment.  
   - Provides feedback to adjust the VCO (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) based on the difference between input and output phases.  
   - Indicates lock status via the `locked` signal once the phase synchronization is achieved.  
   - Handles reset conditions by resetting all internal states and outputs except `rst_n`.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (`clk_in`): 10 MHz to 500 MHz input clock frequency range.  
   - Reset (`rst_n`): Active low reset signal with a minimum pulse width of one full clock cycle.  
   - Divider number (`div_num`): Asynchronous input, can be changed during operation without affecting the locked state.  
   - Clock output enable (`clk_out_enable`): Asynchronous control signal to enable/disable `clk_out`.  
   - Lock detection (`locked`): High after PLL stabilization, dependent on loop bandwidth and damping ratio.  

This specification provides a clear framework for implementing a digital PLL in Verilog, ensuring proper functionality and timing requirements.
