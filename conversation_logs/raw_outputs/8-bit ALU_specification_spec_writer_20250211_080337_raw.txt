Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for an 8-bit ALU. Let me start by understanding what an ALU is. The Arithmetic Logic Unit is a fundamental part of a CPU that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations. For an 8-bit ALU, it should handle operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, etc., on 8-bit operands.

First, I'll think about the module name. It's straightforward: alu_8bit.

Next, the description should briefly mention its purpose. So, "An 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic arithmetic and bitwise operations." That sounds good.

Now, onto the inputs. The ALU needs two 8-bit operands, let's call them A and B. Each will be input as 8 bits. Then there are control signals: operation mode (op_mode), which determines whether it's doing arithmetic or logic operations; a reset signal (rst) to handle resets; and a clock signal (clk) for timing.

For the outputs, the ALU should produce an 8-bit result (result). Additionally, status flags like zero (z), carry out (co), overflow (ov), and negative (n) are essential. Each of these will be single bits.

Moving on to functionality. The ALU needs to support operations like add, subtract, AND, OR, XOR, etc. I'll list the specific operations it should perform based on op_mode. Also, I need to describe how each status flag is generated. For example, z is 1 if the result is zero, co for carry out in addition, ov for overflow in subtraction or addition, and n for the sign bit.

Timing requirements are crucial. The ALU operates synchronously with a clock (clk). The reset signal (rst) should reset all internal states when active. Operations should be completed by the next clock cycle after the inputs are stable.

I need to make sure each part is clearly described without any markdown or extra explanations, just the facts in a structured format as specified.

```  
1. Module Name: alu_8bit  
2. Description: An 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic arithmetic and bitwise operations.  
3. Inputs:  
   - A: 8 input operands for arithmetic/logic operations.  
   - B: 8 input operands for arithmetic/logic operations.  
   - op_mode: 2 control signals to select between arithmetic or logic operations.  
   - rst: 1-bit reset signal (active high).  
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal.  
4. Outputs:  
   - result: 8-bit output of the ALU operation.  
   - z: 1-bit zero flag indicating if the result is zero.  
   - co: 1-bit carry out from the most significant bit during addition.  
   - ov: 1-bit overflow flag for subtraction and addition operations.  
   - n: 1-bit negative flag indicating if the result's sign bit is set.  
5. Functionality:  
   The ALU supports the following operations based on op_mode:  
   - Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR.  
   - Logic Operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT (for single operand).  
   Status flags are updated accordingly:  
   - z is set if result == 0.  
   - co is set for addition overflow beyond 8 bits.  
   - ov is set for subtraction underflow or addition overflow.  
   - n reflects the sign bit of the result.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   The ALU operates synchronously with a clock (clk). All operations complete within one clock cycle after stable inputs. Reset (rst) initializes internal states and outputs to a known state.
