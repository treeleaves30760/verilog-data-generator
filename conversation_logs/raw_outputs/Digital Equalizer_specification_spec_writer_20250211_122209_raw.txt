Okay, so I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Equalizer based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for.

The user provided an example of how they want the specification structured, which is helpful. They mentioned including module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. Plus, they wanted it in a code block without any markdown or extra explanations. So I should follow that structure closely.

First, I'll think about what a Digital Equalizer does. It's a circuit that adjusts the frequency response of an audio signal to correct for inaccuracies in playback systems. In digital terms, this likely involves processing the input audio signal through various filters to shape its frequency characteristics.

Looking at the example provided, it's a 16-bit stereo equalizer with five bands. Each band has gain control and a bypass switch. The inputs are SCK, SFS, D, LR, and the outputs are D_out and EQ_out for each channel. The functionality involves processing each sample based on the selected band and applying the gain.

I need to make sure I cover all these aspects in my specification. Let me break it down:

1. **Module Name**: DigitalEqualizer makes sense.
2. **Description**: Should briefly explain its purpose, like a 16-bit stereo equalizer with five bands, each adjustable with bypass.
3. **Inputs**:
   - SCK: System clock, probably 48 or 96 MHz.
   - SFS: System frame sync, for timing frames in audio data.
   - D: Data input, 16 bits for the audio sample.
   - LR: Left-right indicator to separate left and right channels.
4. **Outputs**:
   - D_out: Processed data output, same width as input.
   - EQ_out: Equalized data output for each channel.
5. **Functionality**: Need to describe how it processes each sample based on the selected band, applies gain, handles bypass, and switches between left and right channels.
6. **Timing Requirements**: Clock and reset details, ensuring metastability with proper clock domains if necessary.

I should also consider any additional features like independent control for each channel, which the example includes. Each EQ_out has its own set of controls, so I'll note that in the functionality section.

Wait, in the example, the inputs are SCK, SFS, D, LR, and outputs are D_out and EQ_out with specific widths. I need to make sure all these points are included accurately.

I should also think about any potential issues. For instance, ensuring that the equalizer handles both left and right channels correctly based on the LR input. Also, considering how the gain is appliedâ€”whether it's multiplied in the digital domain, which would require some arithmetic operations.

Another point is the bypass functionality. When a band is bypassed, its gain should be 0dB, so no processing is needed for that band. The specification needs to clearly state this behavior.

I also need to make sure that the timing requirements are clear, especially regarding clock and reset signals. Proper handling of asynchronous resets can prevent metastability issues in clock domains.

In summary, I'll structure the specification step by step, ensuring each section accurately reflects the functionality and requirements of a digital equalizer as described.

```  
1. Module Name: DigitalEqualizer  
2. Description: A 16-bit stereo digital equalizer with five adjustable frequency bands, providing gain control for each band and a bypass feature for individual bands.  
3. Inputs:  
   - SCK: 1 bit System Clock  
   - SFS: 1 bit System Frame Sync  
   - D: 16 bits Audio Data Input  
   - LR: 1 bit Left/Right Channel Indicator  
4. Outputs:  
   - D_out: 16 bits Processed Audio Data Output  
   - EQ_out: 5 bits Equalizer Band Control Outputs (one per band)  
5. Functionality:  
   The DigitalEqualizer processes each audio sample based on the selected frequency band and applies the corresponding gain adjustment. Each band can be independently bypassed by setting its respective EQ_out control bit to 0. The equalizer operates on both left and right channels, with channel selection determined by the LR input.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: SCK (System Clock) at 48 MHz or 96 MHz  
   - Reset: Asynchronous reset signal for initialization  
   - Frame Sync: SFS to synchronize frame-based operations
