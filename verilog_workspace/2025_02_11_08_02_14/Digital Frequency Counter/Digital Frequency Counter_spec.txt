Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Frequency Counter based on the user's example. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I'll start by understanding what a digital frequency counter does. It measures the frequency of an input signal over a specific time period. The key components are a clock, a reset button, an input signal whose frequency we're measuring, and outputs that display the measured frequency in binary or hexadecimal.

Looking at the example provided, the module is named `digital_frequency_counter` with inputs like clk, rst_n, and freq_in, and outputs for hex display. The functionality includes counting the input pulses within a time window defined by the clock cycles, then converting that count into frequency and displaying it.

I need to structure my specification similarly but ensure all necessary details are included. Let me break down each section:

1. **Module Name**: Straightforward, I'll name it `digital_frequency_counter`.

2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the module does—measuring input signal frequency over a time window and displaying the result.

3. **Inputs**:
   - clk: System clock.
   - rst_n: Active-low reset.
   - freq_in: The input signal whose frequency is to be measured.

4. **Outputs**:
   - hex_display: Six-digit hexadecimal display for the frequency.
   - segment_output: Control signals for the seven-segment displays.
   - anode_common: Common anode control for the display segments.
   - led_status: Status LEDs, maybe indicating whether the counter is running or if there's an overflow.

5. **Functionality**:
   - The counter should measure the number of freq_in pulses within a fixed window (like 1 second) by dividing the clock to get a time base.
   - Use a counter to count these pulses and calculate frequency as count divided by the time window.
   - Convert this value into hexadecimal for display on six seven-segment digits, handling overflow if necessary.

6. **Timing Requirements**:
   - Clock is typically 50MHz, but could vary based on design constraints.
   - Reset is active-low, so when rst_n is low, all counters and displays reset.
   - The conversion of count to frequency should happen periodically, maybe every second, using a time window counter.

I also need to consider how the display works. Each digit on the seven-segment display will be controlled by segment_output and anode_common signals. Maybe each digit lights up sequentially to create a multiplexed display effect, but for simplicity, perhaps all segments are active at once with common anode control.

For the frequency calculation, I'll need a time window counter that increments every clock cycle until it reaches a certain value (like 50 million for a 50MHz clock, giving a 1-second window). Each freq_in pulse during this window is counted. Once the window ends, the frequency is calculated as count / window_cycles and then converted to hex.

I should also think about overflow conditions—what happens if the count exceeds the maximum displayable value? Maybe an overflow LED lights up or the display rolls over.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section with clear inputs, outputs, functionality steps, and timing details. Make sure to specify widths for signals where necessary, like 6 bits for hex_display (but actually, each digit is a nibble, so maybe more lines needed). Wait, in the example, hex_display was 24 bits—each of six digits is 4 bits, so that makes sense.

I need to ensure all parts are covered without being too vague. Maybe add details about how the seven-segment display is controlled, perhaps using a common anode or cathode setup, and how each segment is activated based on the hex digit.

Also, considering the reset functionality—when rst_n is low, all counters reset, displays clear, etc. And when released, the system starts measuring again.

I think that's a solid plan. Now I'll structure this into the required format without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text as per the user's request.

1. Module Name: digital_frequency_counter  
2. Description: A module that measures and displays the frequency of an input signal in hexadecimal format using seven-segment displays.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit (System clock)  
   - rst_n: 1 bit (Active-low reset signal)  
   - freq_in: 1 bit (Input signal whose frequency is to be measured)  
4. Outputs:  
   - hex_display: 24 bits (Six-digit hexadecimal display for the measured frequency, each digit represented by 4 bits)  
   - segment_output: 7 bits (Control signals for each segment of the seven-segment displays)  
   - anode_common: 6 bits (Common anode control signals for each digit of the display)  
   - led_status: 3 bits (Status LEDs indicating operation, overflow, and reset states)  
5. Functionality:  
   - Measures the frequency of freq_in by counting the number of pulses within a fixed time window (e.g., 1 second).  
   - Converts the count into frequency in Hz and displays it as a hexadecimal value on six seven-segment digits.  
   - Includes overflow detection for high frequencies beyond the display range, indicated by an LED.  
   - Implements a reset functionality to clear all counters and displays upon assertion of rst_n.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - clk: 50 MHz (System clock)  
   - rst_n: Active-low reset signal with asynchronous behavior.  
   - Time window for frequency measurement is determined by the clock cycle and counter overflow, typically set to 1 second.
