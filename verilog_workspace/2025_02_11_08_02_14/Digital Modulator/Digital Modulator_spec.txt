2. Description: A digital modulator that encodes binary input data into a modulated output signal using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) technique.  
3. Inputs:  
   - data_in: 8-bit Binary input data to be modulated.  
   - clk: 1-bit Clock signal for timing operations.  
   - rst: 1-bit Active-high reset signal to initialize the module.  
4. Outputs:  
   - encoded_out: 16-bit Modulated output signal representing the encoded binary data.  
5. Functionality:  
   The DigitalModulator takes an 8-bit binary input and maps it to a QPSK symbol by converting two bits into one of four possible symbols (00, 01, 10, 11). The modulated output is then generated by adjusting the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal based on the mapped symbols.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: Positive-edge triggered synchronous design.  
   - Reset: Active-high reset signal that resets all internal states when asserted.  
   - Data Validity: data_in is valid on the rising edge of the clock.
