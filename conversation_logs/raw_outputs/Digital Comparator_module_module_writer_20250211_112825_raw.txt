Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-bit digital comparator that compares two binary numbers and outputs their relationship—whether they're equal, greater than, or less than. The user provided specific inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements.

First, I'll start by defining the module with the correct name and ports. The module should be named `comparator_4bit` with inputs A, B as 4-bit wires, and outputs E, G, L as single bits. Also, it needs clock and reset signals.

Next, considering the functionality: the comparator must compare each bit starting from the MSB to LSB. If all bits are equal, E is set. Otherwise, determine if A is greater or less than B based on where they first differ.

I'll use a synthesis-friendly approach without using case statements since they can lead to non-synthesizable constructs in some cases. Instead, I'll implement the logic using bitwise operations and condition checks.

For the timing requirements, the critical path must be <=10ns for a 100MHz clock. This suggests that the design should be simple enough to meet this delay without complex combinational logic. Since we're dealing with 4 bits, the maximum number of comparisons is manageable within this constraint.

I'll implement the comparison by iterating through each bit from MSB (bit 3) to LSB (bit 0). I'll use a loop or conditional checks to determine where A and B first differ. If all bits are equal after checking all positions, set E=1. Otherwise, compare the differing bit to decide G or L.

I should also ensure that the module handles reset properly—on rst high, all outputs should be reset to 0.

Finally, I'll write the Verilog code with clear comments explaining each part of the logic for better readability.

```verilog
module comparator_4bit (
    input wire [3:0] A,
    input wire [3:0] B,
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg E,
    output reg G,
    output reg L
);

    // Reset signals
    always @(posedge rst) begin
        E <= 0;
        G <= 0;
        L <= 0;
    end

    // Clocking process for comparison logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst == 1) begin
            E <= 0;
            G <= 0;
            L <= 0;
        end else begin
            E <= 0;
            G <= 0;
            L <= 0;

            // Compare each bit from MSB to LSB
            if (A[3] > B[3]) begin
                G <= 1;
            elsif (A[3] < B[3]) begin
                L <= 1;
            end else begin
                // If MSBs are equal, move to next bit
                if (A[2] > B[2]) begin
                    G <= 1;
                elsif (A[2] < B[2]) begin
                    L <= 1;
                end else begin
                    if (A[1] > B[1]) begin
                        G <= 1;
                    elsif (A[1] < B[1]) begin
                        L <= 1;
                    end else begin
                        if (A[0] > B[0]) begin
                            G <= 1;
                        elsif (A[0] < B[0]) begin
                            L <= 1;
                        end else begin
                            E <= 1;
                        end
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
