Okay, I need to create a Verilog specification for an SD Card Interface based on the user's example. Let me start by understanding what the user provided.

The user gave an example of a specification for an SD Card Interface with sections: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. Each section had specific details, like input and output names, widths, and descriptions.

Now, I need to create a similar specification but in a clear format without any markdown or code blocks. The user emphasized that only the specification should be provided, so I must avoid any additional explanations.

First, I'll think about the SD Card Interface's key components. It typically involves communication with an SD card, which includes commands and data handling. So, the module name would likely be something like sd_card_interface.

For the description, it should briefly mention that this module interfaces with an SD card, handling commands and data under a specific clock. 

Next, the inputs. The example included clock (clk), reset (rst_n), command (cmd) with some width, data (data) lines, write protect (wp), and power on (vcc_on). I'll need to list these similarly but ensure the widths are appropriate for an SD card interface.

The outputs would include acknowledge (ack), data valid (data_valid), ready (rdy), and error flags like cmd_err, data_err, and bus Timeout. Each should have a width of 1 since they're typically single bits.

In the functionality section, I need to outline what the module does: it processes commands, handles data transfer in both read and write modes, manages flow control with ready signals, detects errors, and handles power management. It's important to mention that it follows the SD card protocol and uses a specific clock for timing.

For timing requirements, the example mentioned a clock frequency of 25MHz, active-high reset, and specific timing constraints like setup, hold, and data valid durations. I should include similar details but ensure they're accurate for an SD interface.

I also need to make sure that each section is clearly labeled and follows the structure provided in the example. The inputs and outputs should be listed with their respective widths and descriptions, using bullet points as shown.

Wait, the user mentioned not to use markdown or code blocks, so I'll avoid any formatting beyond what's necessary. Each input and output will be on separate lines under their respective sections.

I should double-check that all necessary signals are included. For example, in an SD card interface, there are typically data lines (D0-D3), command line (CMD), clock (CLK), write protect (WP), and power on (VCC). Also, outputs like acknowledge (ACK) and ready (RDY) are essential.

I should also consider the width of each signal. For example, data lines might be 4 bits wide (D0 to D3), but in the example, it was listed as a single line with a width of 4. That makes sense because data is often multiplexed or sent over multiple lines, but in Verilog, sometimes they're represented as a bus.

I need to ensure that the functionality description is clear and concise, explaining how the module processes commands, handles data, manages flow control, detects errors, and controls power without going into too much detail.

For timing requirements, I'll specify the clock frequency, reset polarity, setup and hold times for inputs, and the duration of data valid signals. These details are crucial for proper synchronization and operation.

I should also include error detection mechanisms, such as checking parity or command formats, which would set the error flags accordingly.

Finally, I need to make sure that all sections are present and follow the structure exactly as provided in the example, without adding any extra information or explanations beyond what's necessary.
