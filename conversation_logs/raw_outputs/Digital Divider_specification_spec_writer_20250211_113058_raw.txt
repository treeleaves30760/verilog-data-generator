--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a digital divider. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should understand what a digital divider does. It's a circuit that takes two input numbers and produces their quotient and remainder. Right.

The user provided an example of how the spec should look. Let me review that to make sure I'm on the right track. The module name is "divider," with inputs like dividend, divisor, clock, reset, and outputs for quotient, remainder, done, overflow, and underflow. That makes sense because a divider needs these signals to function properly.

I think I should structure my specification similarly. Let me break it down step by step. 

1. **Module Name**: I'll name it "digital_divider" since that's what the user asked for. It's clear and descriptive.

2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the module does. Something like, "This module performs division operations on two unsigned binary numbers."

3. **Inputs**:
   - `dividend`: I'll need to decide the width. Let's say 8 bits since it's a common size for demonstration.
   - `divisor`: Also 8 bits.
   - `clk`: Clock signal, standard in digital circuits.
   - `rst`: Reset signal, active high or low? Probably active high for simplicity.
   - `start`: To initiate the division process.

4. **Outputs**:
   - `quotient`: The result of the division, probably 8 bits as well.
   - `remainder`: What's left after division, same width as dividend.
   - `done`: A flag to indicate when the operation is complete.
   - `overflow`: If the dividend exceeds divisor * (2^width), this should be high.
   - `underflow`: If the dividend is less than the divisor and not zero, this would signal underflow.

5. **Functionality**: I need to describe how the module works. It should perform unsigned division, handle cases where dividend < divisor by setting quotient to 0 and remainder to dividend, and detect overflow when necessary. Also, it should wait until the start signal is high before beginning the operation.

6. **Timing Requirements**: The divider needs a clock for synchronous operations. Reset will bring all states back to a known point. Start is an asynchronous input because division can be initiated at any time, independent of the clock.

Wait, in the example provided, the user included specific timing details like start being asynchronous and done being asserted on the positive edge of the clock when the operation completes. I should follow that structure too.

I also need to make sure all necessary signals are included. For instance, handling underflow is important because if the dividend is smaller than the divisor but not zero, we can't divide further without a fraction, so we set quotient to 0 and remainder equals dividend.

Let me think about edge cases. What if divisor is zero? Oh, that's undefined behavior, so I should note that in the functionality section or perhaps add an error signal, but maybe that's beyond the scope here.

Another point: when start is high, the divider begins the operation. It might take multiple clock cycles to complete, depending on the size of the numbers. So done will be asserted after all operations are finished.

I should also mention that overflow occurs when dividend is greater than or equal to divisor multiplied by 2^width. For example, if width is 8 bits, then divisor * 256 would cause an overflow because the quotient can't fit into 8 bits anymore.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section clearly, making sure each input and output is listed with their respective widths and descriptions. The functionality should explain the division process, handling of underflow and overflow, and the role of start, done, overflow, and underflow signals.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I just need to write it out in the specified format without any markdown or code blocks, keeping each section concise and clear.

1. Module Name: digital_divider
2. Description: This module performs division operations on two unsigned binary numbers.
3. Inputs:
   - dividend: 8-bit input representing the dividend number.
   - divisor: 8-bit input representing the divisor number.
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal (active edge: rising)
   - rst: 1-bit reset signal (active high)
   - start: 1-bit signal to initiate division operation
4. Outputs:
   - quotient: 8-bit output representing the result of division.
   - remainder: 8-bit output representing the remainder after division.
   - done: 1-bit flag indicating completion of division operation.
   - overflow: 1-bit flag indicating if dividend exceeds divisor * 2^width.
   - underflow: 1-bit flag indicating if dividend is less than divisor and not zero.
5. Functionality:
   The digital_divider module performs unsigned division of two binary numbers, dividend and divisor. It calculates the quotient and remainder. When start is asserted (high), the operation begins. The done signal is raised when the division process completes. Overflow occurs when dividend >= divisor * 2^width, and underflow occurs when dividend < divisor and dividend != 0. The module handles edge cases such as division by zero gracefully.
6. Timing Requirements:
   -clk: Positive-edge clock signal for synchronous operations.
   -rst: Active-high reset signal to initialize the module state.
   -start: Asynchronous input to trigger division operation; must be high before processing begins.
