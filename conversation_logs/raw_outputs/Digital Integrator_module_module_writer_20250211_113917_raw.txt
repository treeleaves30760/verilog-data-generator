Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 2-to-1 multiplexer based on the user's specifications. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, I'll start by understanding the requirements. The module should have two inputs (in0 and in1), one control input (sel), and one output (out). The selection input sel will determine which of the two inputs is passed to the output. If sel is 0, out should be equal to in0; if sel is 1, out should be equal to in1.

Next, I'll consider how to implement this efficiently in Verilog. The most straightforward way is to use a conditional statement within an always block. This approach is synthesizable and works well for simple multiplexers.

I need to make sure the module name matches exactly what's specified: my_mux. The ports should also be named as given: in0, in1, sel, and out. I'll set the input and output types accordinglyâ€”inputs are wire type, and the output is reg since it's driven by a procedural block.

Including clear comments is important for readability. I'll add a comment explaining that the module selects between two inputs based on the sel signal.

I should avoid using non-synthesizable constructs like initial blocks or forever loops. The always @* statement is appropriate here because it ensures the output updates whenever any of its inputs change, which is efficient and correct.

Testing the code mentally: when sel is 0, out should be in0; when sel is 1, out should switch to in1. This logic seems solid and shouldn't have any issues with timing or latches since the selection is straightforward.

Finally, I'll structure the Verilog code within a ```verilog block as specified, ensuring that only the code is provided without any explanations or additional text.

```verilog
module my_mux (
    input wire in0,
    input wire in1,
    input wire sel,
    output reg out
);

    always @* 
        if (sel == 0) 
            out = in0;
        else 
            out = in1;

endmodule
```
