2. Description: A digital band stop filter designed to suppress frequencies within a specified stop band while allowing signals outside this range to pass through.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Active-low reset signal  
   - data_in: 16 bits Input digital signal to be filtered  
   - coefficients: 16 bits Filter coefficients for stop band suppression  
   - enable: 1 bit Enable control signal  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: 16 bits Output digital signal after filtering  
   - valid: 1 bit Indicates if the output is valid  
   - overflow: 1 bit Detects overflow conditions during processing  
5. Functionality:  
   The filter operates based on IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) or FIR (Finite Impulse Response) algorithm, depending on the implementation. It includes:  
   - Coefficient memory to store filter coefficients for stop band suppression.  
   - Arithmetic units for signal processing and coefficient multiplication.  
   - Control logic to manage enable/disable functionality and reset operations.  
   - Validity checking to ensure output integrity.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz System clock  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active-low asynchronous reset with hold time of 2 clock cycles  
   - Filter processing latency: 32 clock cycles for coefficient application
