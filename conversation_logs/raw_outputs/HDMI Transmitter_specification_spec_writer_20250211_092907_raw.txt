Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for an HDMI transmitter based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided an example of how they want the specification structured, including module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. They emphasized using only the specified format without any markdown or code blocks, but in their follow-up, they included a code block despite that instruction. Hmm, maybe they just wanted it formatted for clarity.

First, I should identify all the key components of an HDMI transmitter. HDMI transmits video and audio signals, so the transmitter must handle high-speed data, including clock signals, video data (like RGB), and auxiliary data like audio or control information.

Looking at the example provided, the module name is "hdmi_transmitter." The description mentions handling TMDS (Transition Minimized Differential Signaling) encoding. That makes sense because TMDS is used in HDMI to reduce electromagnetic interference.

For inputs, I see clock signals (pixel clock and TMDS clock), video data (RGB with specific bit depths), sync signals (HSYNC, VSYNC), audio data, and a reset signal. The outputs are the TMDS differential pairs for each channel (TMDS_A, TMDS_B, TMDS_C, TMDS_D) along with their clocks.

The functionality section outlines encoding RGB into TMDS streams, handling sync, audio integration, and clock generation. I need to make sure all these aspects are covered clearly.

Timing requirements include a pixel clock of 120 MHz, which is typical for high-resolution displays. The reset signal is active low, so it should be specified as such. Also, the TMDS encoding must meet HDMI standards, which might involve specific timing constraints and skew management between data and clock signals.

I should ensure that each input and output is clearly defined with their respective widths and descriptions. For example, RGB data might be 24 bits (8 bits per channel), but sometimes higher bit depths like 30 or 36 are used for deeper color. Including both would make the spec more comprehensive.

The functionality needs to explain how each part works: how RGB is encoded into TMDS, handling of sync signals, audio integration, and clock generation. It's important to mention that the module should adhere to HDMI standards to ensure compatibility.

In terms of timing, specifying the pixel clock frequency and reset polarity is crucial for proper operation. Also, ensuring low skew between data and clock outputs will help in maintaining signal integrity on the transmission line.

I should also consider if there are any additional signals or considerations, like hot plug detect or other control pins, but perhaps those can be addressed in a more detailed spec later. For now, focusing on the core functionality as per the example is key.

Finally, I need to present all this information without using markdown, just plain text with clear sections. Even though the user mentioned not to use code blocks, they included one in their follow-up, so maybe it's acceptable for formatting purposes.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section methodically, ensuring that each part is concise and covers all necessary details without being overly verbose.
