- rst_n: 1 bit Description: Active-low reset signal.  
- addr: 15 bits Description: Memory address (row, column, bank).  
- cmd: 4 bits Description: Command interface (read, write, activate, refresh, etc.).  
- dmask: 8 bits Description: Data mask for write operations.  
- wdata: 64 bits Description: Write data input.  
- rdata: 64 bits Description: Read data output (tri-stated).

- intr_i: 1 bit Description: Interrupt output to the system.  

Functionality:  
The DDR3 Memory Controller manages all aspects of memory operations, including command sequencing, address translation, data masking, and timing compliance. It supports burst mode operations, refresh cycles (manual and auto), error detection, and interrupt handling. The controller ensures proper setup and hold times for inputs relative to the clock and generates differential clocks for the memory interface.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock (clk): 160 MHz  
- Reset (rst_n): Active-low reset with a minimum of 100 ns.  
- Setup time for all inputs relative to clk: 0.5 ns.  
- Hold time for all inputs relative to clk: 0.5 ns.  
- Output timing for data and commands must meet DDR3 specifications, including CK-to-DQ skew control.
