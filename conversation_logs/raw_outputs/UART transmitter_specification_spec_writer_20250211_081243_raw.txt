Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a UART transmitter. Let me think about what that entails.

First, I should start by understanding what a UART transmitter does. UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It's responsible for converting parallel data into serial form, which can then be transmitted over a communication channel. So the main functions would include handling the transmission of data bits, managing the start and stop bits, and controlling the baud rate.

Now, looking at the structure I need to follow: module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. The user provided an example for a UART transmitter, so maybe I can use that as a reference but make sure it's detailed enough for implementation.

For the module name, it should be something clear like uart_transmitter.

The description needs to briefly explain what the module does. So, "UART Transmitter Module" followed by a brief overview of its functions: converting parallel data to serial, managing start and stop bits, baud rate generation, etc.

Next are the inputs. I need to list all necessary input signals with their widths and descriptions. From the example, there were clock (clk), reset (rst), data_in (data_in), send_enable (send_en), and maybe a ready signal (tx_ready). Each of these should have their respective widths and explanations.

Outputs would include the serial data output (tx_data), a busy signal (tx_busy), and perhaps an acknowledge signal when transmission is complete (tx_done). Again, each with their widths and descriptions.

Functionality needs to be clearly described. This includes how the module operates: it waits for send_enable to go high, then starts transmitting by sending the start bit, followed by data bits, and ending with a stop bit. It should handle the baud rate using a clock divider. Also, it needs to manage the state machine transitions between idle, transmitting, etc.

Timing requirements are crucial. The module operates on a clock (clk) with a certain frequency, usually 50MHz as in the example. Reset is active high, so when rst is high, the module resets. The send_enable should be synchronized with the clock to avoid issues with setup and hold times.

I also need to consider edge cases: what happens if send_en changes during transmission? Maybe it's ignored until the current transmission completes. Also, ensuring that the start bit is correctly sent before the data bits, and the stop bit follows after all data bits are sent.

Another point is the baud rate generation. The example used a BAUD_RATE of 16, which divides the clock to get the correct timing for each bit. So I should mention how the baud rate is set and how it affects the timing.

I might also need to think about the number of data bits. In the example, it's 8 bits, but perhaps in a more detailed spec, that could be configurable or fixed. Since the user didn't specify, maybe assuming 8 bits is fine.

Wait, in the example provided by the user, they included a tx_done signal which goes high when transmission is complete. So I should include that as an output and describe how it's used.

I also need to make sure that all signals are properly defined with their widths. For example, data_in is 8 bits wide, send_en is 1 bit, etc.

Putting this together, the specification should be clear and structured so that someone can implement the Verilog code based on it without ambiguity.
