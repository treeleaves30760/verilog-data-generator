Description: A 32-bit floating-point adder implementing IEEE 754 addition with special value handling.  

Inputs:  
- a: 32-bit input number  
- b: 32-bit input number  
- clk: clock signal  
- rst: asynchronous reset  

Outputs:  
- sum: 32-bit output number  
- invalid_op: 1-bit flag indicating an invalid operation (e.g., NaNs)  
- div_by_zero: 1-bit flag for overflow due to division by zero  
- overflow: 1-bit flag for overflow during addition  

Functionality:  
The floating-point adder performs the following operations:  
1. Adds two 32-bit floating-point numbers according to IEEE 754 standard.  
2. Handles special cases such as NaN, infinity, and zero.  
3. Detects underflow and overflow conditions.  
4. Sets status flags for invalid operations, division by zero, and overflow.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock (clk): 10ns period  
- Reset (rst): Asynchronous reset active high
