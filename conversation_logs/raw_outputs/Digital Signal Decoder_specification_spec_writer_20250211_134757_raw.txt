Alright, so I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Decoder based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of how they want the specification structured. It includes Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. They emphasized using only the specified format without any markdown or code blocks, but in their own response, they included a code block with the spec inside it. Hmm, maybe they just wanted the content to be clear and structured, even if it's within a code block.

I should follow that structure closely. The module name is "digital_signal_decoder." For the description, I need something brief yet informativeâ€”maybe mention its purpose in converting encoded digital signals into decoded outputs.

Looking at the inputs, there are three: clk, rst_n, and encoded_data_in. Each has a width and a description. I should ensure that each input is clearly defined so someone implementing it knows what they're dealing with.

For outputs, the user included decoded_data_out and maybe an optional status flag like decode_error. It's good to include error handling for robustness, so I'll add that as an output.

The functionality section needs a clear description of operations. The decoder should process the input data based on a specific encoding scheme, handle synchronization with a reset signal, and manage clock timing. I'll outline these steps in bullet points for clarity.

Timing requirements are crucial. The user mentioned a clock frequency, reset polarity, and setup/hold times. I need to specify that the module operates at 100 MHz, uses a falling-edge reset (rst_n), and has standard setup and hold times for asynchronous inputs.

I should also note that all signals are synchronous to the clock, which is important for proper circuit operation. Including optional notes about error handling and testability would be beneficial for implementation.

Putting it all together, I'll structure each section as per the example, ensuring each part is concise and covers all necessary details without being overly verbose. This way, anyone reading the specification can easily understand how to implement the digital signal decoder in Verilog.

```verilog
Module Name: digital_signal_decoder  
Description: A module that decodes encoded digital signals into a decoded output format.  

Inputs:  
- clk: 1 Description: System clock input.  
- rst_n: 1 Description: Active-low reset input.  
- encoded_data_in: N Description: Encoded digital data input (variable width based on encoding scheme).  

Outputs:  
- decoded_data_out: M Description: Decoded digital data output (variable width based on decoding scheme).  
- decode_error: 1 Description: Optional flag indicating decoding errors (if implemented).  

Functionality:  
The decoder processes the encoded_data_in according to a specific encoding scheme and produces the corresponding decoded_data_out. The module includes:  
- Synchronization logic for clock and reset signals.  
- Decoding algorithm implementation based on defined encoding standards.  
- Error detection and reporting (optional).  
- Latency handling as per decoding requirements.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock: clk Description: 100 MHz system clock.  
- Reset: rst_n Description: Active-low reset signal for module initialization.  
- Timing Details: All inputs are synchronous to the rising edge of clk. Asynchronous inputs (if any) must meet setup and hold times relative to clk.  

Notes:  
- The decoding algorithm must be specified in the implementation.  
- Error handling is optional but recommended for robust designs.
