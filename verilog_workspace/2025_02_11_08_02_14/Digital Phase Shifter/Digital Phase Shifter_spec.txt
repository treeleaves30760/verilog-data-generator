Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Phase Shifter. Let me start by understanding what a digital phase shifter does. From what I know, it's a circuit that shifts the phase of a digital signal by a certain angle, which can be adjusted. This is useful in various applications like communication systems where timing adjustments are necessary.

First, I'll think about the module name. It should clearly indicate its purpose, so "DigitalPhaseShifter" seems appropriate.

Next, the description. It needs to be brief but informative. So, something like: "A digital phase shifter that adjusts the phase of an input clock signal by a specified angle, with controllable shift amount and direction."

Moving on to inputs. The primary input is the clock signal. I'll need aclk for the main clock and aclr for the clear signal. Then there's the shift_amount, which determines how much phase to shift. Since it can be up to 360 degrees, using 8 bits (9-bit including the sign) makes sense because 2^9 is 512, which covers all possible shifts. I'll include a direction bit to specify whether to shift left or right.

For outputs, the main output is the shifted clock signal, dout. It should have the same width as the input clock, probably 1 bit. Additionally, an error flag, error, will indicate if the shift amount exceeds 360 degrees.

Now, functionality. The phase shifter should take the input clock and adjust its phase based on shift_amount and direction. If the shift is more than 360 or less than -360, it wraps around, but we'll set an error flag in that case.

Timing requirements are crucial. It needs a main clock, a clear signal, and the shift_amount should be stable when the clock is valid. The shifted output should be ready after one clock cycle, with some setup time for the inputs.

I also need to consider how the phase shifting works. One approach is to use a counter that increments or decrements based on the direction and shift amount. When the counter overflows or underflows, it wraps around, adjusting the phase accordingly.

Wait, I should make sure that the shift_amount is within the correct range before applying it. If not, set the error flag. Also, the clear signal should reset all internal states to ensure proper operation upon assertion.

I think I've covered all necessary parts: module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. Now, putting it all together in the specified format without any markdown or code blocks.

1. Module Name: DigitalPhaseShifter  
2. Description: A digital phase shifter that adjusts the phase of an input clock signal by a specified angle, with controllable shift amount and direction.  
3. Inputs:  
   - aclk: 1 bit (main clock input)  
   - aclr: 1 bit (asynchronous clear input)  
   - shift_amount: 9 bits (signed integer representing phase shift in degrees, range: -512 to +511)  
   - direction: 1 bit (0 for left shift, 1 for right shift)  
4. Outputs:  
   - dout: 1 bit (phase-shifted clock output)  
   - error: 1 bit (indicates invalid shift amount or overflow/underflow condition)  
5. Functionality:  
   The DigitalPhaseShifter adjusts the phase of the input clock signal based on the shift_amount and direction. It supports shifting in both left (counter-clockwise) and right (clockwise) directions. The shift_amount is specified in degrees, with a range of -360 to +360 degrees. If the shift_amount exceeds Â±360 degrees, the error flag is set. The phase shifter ensures that the output clock maintains the same frequency as the input clock but with an adjusted phase.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock Input: aclk (active-high)  
   - Reset: aclr (active-low asynchronous reset)  
   - Shift Amount Stability: shift_amount must be stable during the rising edge of aclk.  
   - Output Latency: dout is valid one clock cycle after the shift operation is applied.  
   - Setup Time: Inputs must be stable for at least one clock cycle before any rising edge of aclk.
