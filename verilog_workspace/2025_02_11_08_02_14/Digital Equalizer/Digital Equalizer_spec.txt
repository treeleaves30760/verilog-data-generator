2. Description: A 16-bit stereo digital equalizer with five adjustable frequency bands, providing gain control for each band and a bypass feature for individual bands.  
3. Inputs:  
   - SCK: 1 bit System Clock  
   - SFS: 1 bit System Frame Sync  
   - D: 16 bits Audio Data Input  
   - LR: 1 bit Left/Right Channel Indicator  
4. Outputs:  
   - D_out: 16 bits Processed Audio Data Output  
   - EQ_out: 5 bits Equalizer Band Control Outputs (one per band)  
5. Functionality:  
   The DigitalEqualizer processes each audio sample based on the selected frequency band and applies the corresponding gain adjustment. Each band can be independently bypassed by setting its respective EQ_out control bit to 0. The equalizer operates on both left and right channels, with channel selection determined by the LR input.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: SCK (System Clock) at 48 MHz or 96 MHz  
   - Reset: Asynchronous reset signal for initialization  
   - Frame Sync: SFS to synchronize frame-based operations
