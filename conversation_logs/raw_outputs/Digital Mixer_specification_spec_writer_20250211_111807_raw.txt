Okay, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Mixer based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

The user provided an example of a specification for a Digital Mixer and wants me to generate something similar but in a clear format without any markdown or code blocks. They emphasized including all necessary details for implementation, so I should make sure the spec is comprehensive.

First, I'll look at the structure they want: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. Each section needs to be clearly defined with bullet points where applicable.

For the Module Name, it's straightforward—DigitalMixer. The description should briefly explain what the mixer does, so I'll mention combining multiple input signals with adjustable levels and effects processing.

Next are the Inputs. I need to list all necessary ports. From the example, there are 8 input channels (each 16 bits), a clock, reset, and various control signals like gain adjusts, pan controls, mute switches, effect enable, and Bypass. Each input should have its width and description.

Outputs include the main output, auxiliary output for effects loop, and maybe a status bit indicating if any channel is muted or if there's an overload. The example had 16 bits for each output, so I'll follow that.

Functionality needs to be detailed. I'll outline how each input is scaled by gain, panning, and volume. Then explain the effects loop—how it processes a selected channel when enabled. Also, include the bypass feature where the unmuted inputs are summed directly. Mute detection and output status should be mentioned too.

Timing Requirements: The clock is 48 kHz, which is standard for audio. Reset is active-high with a low-to-high transition initializing the gain and pan to default values. I'll note that all operations are synchronous to the clock.

I need to ensure each section is concise but thorough, avoiding any extra explanations since the user wants only the specification. Also, no markdown or code blocks—just plain text with proper line breaks.

Let me double-check if I missed any inputs or outputs. The example had 8 channels, so I'll stick with that. Effects processing is optional, so it's included as an input control. Mute detection and bypass are important for functionality, so they're part of the spec.

I think that covers everything. Now, I'll structure each section clearly, making sure each bullet point is descriptive enough for implementation without being too verbose.

```  
1. Module Name: DigitalMixer  
2. Description: A digital audio mixer that combines multiple input signals with adjustable gain, panning, and effects processing.  
3. Inputs:  
   - in_signal[7:0][15:0]: 16-bit audio signal for each of the 8 input channels  
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal (48 kHz)  
   - rst_n: 1-bit active-high reset signal  
   - gain_adjust[7:0][4:0]: 5-bit gain adjustment value for each channel  
   - pan_control[7:0][3:0]: 4-bit panning control value for each channel (left/right balance)  
   - volume_control[7:0][4:0]: 5-bit volume level setting for each channel  
   - effect_enable[7:0]: 1-bit control to enable effects processing for each channel  
   - bypass_mode[7:0]: 1-bit control to bypass processing for each channel  
   - mute_switch[7:0]: 1-bit switch to mute/unmute each input channel  
4. Outputs:  
   - out_signal[15:0]: 16-bit mixed audio output (main output)  
   - aux_out_signal[15:0]: 16-bit effects loop output  
   - status_bit[0]: 1-bit status indicator (high if any input is muted or overloaded)  
5. Functionality:  
   - Each input channel's signal is scaled by its gain, pan, and volume controls.  
   - Effects processing (e.g., reverb, delay) can be applied to selected channels when enabled.  
   - Bypass mode allows unmuted inputs to pass through without processing.  
   - Mute detection: If any channel is muted, the status bit is set high.  
   - Output signals are summed and routed to main and auxiliary outputs based on effects routing.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 48 kHz sampling rate  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active-high reset with low-to-high transition initializing all gain and pan values to default positions  
   - All operations are synchronous to the clock signal
