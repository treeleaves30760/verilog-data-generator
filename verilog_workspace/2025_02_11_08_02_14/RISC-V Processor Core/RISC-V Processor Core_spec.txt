2. Description:  
   A 32-bit RISC-V processor core implementing the RV32I instruction set architecture.  

3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Asynchronous reset active low  
   - inst: 32 bits Instruction memory read data  
   - dadr: 32 bits Data address (AXI)  
   - drd: 32 bits Data read (AXI)  
   - dwrdv: 1 bit Data write valid (AXI)  
   - branch_addr: 32 bits Branch address from the instruction decode stage  
   - jump_addr: 32 bits Jump address from the instruction decode stage  

4. Outputs:  
   - pc: 32 bits Program counter output  
   - ctrl: 16 bits Control signals (ALU control, register file control)  
   - dadr: 32 bits Data memory write address  
   - drd: 32 bits Data read data  
   - dwr: 32 bits Data write data  
   - dwrdv: 1 bit Data write valid  
   - intr_ack: 1 bit Interrupt acknowledge  

5. Functionality:  
   The RISC-V core executes instructions from the RV32I instruction set. It includes an instruction fetch stage, decode stage, and execute stage. The core supports arithmetic and logical operations (ALU), branch/jump instructions, interrupt handling, and load/store operations to memory. The processor uses a 5-stage pipeline: IF-ID-EX-WB.  

6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): Positive edge triggered synchronous design  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active low asynchronous reset  
   - Synchronous write operations to memory (dwrdv) must be aligned with the clock edge  
   - Interrupts are handled in the EX stage and require synchronized acknowledgment
