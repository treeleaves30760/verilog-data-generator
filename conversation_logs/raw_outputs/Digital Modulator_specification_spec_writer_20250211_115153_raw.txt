Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Modulator based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what exactly is required here.

First, the user mentioned they are a Verilog specification writer and want clear, structured specs for digital circuit designs. They provided an example response in code blocks, so I should follow that format closely without using markdown or code blocks as per their instructions.

The module name should be something descriptive, like "DigitalModulator". The description needs to briefly explain what it does—probably modulating a digital input signal by varying its amplitude, frequency, or phase. 

Next, the inputs and outputs. For inputs, I'll need at least a data_in with a certain width, say 8 bits for flexibility. There should also be a clock (clk) and a reset (rst) signal, which are standard in digital designs. The output will likely be an encoded signal, maybe 16 bits wide to accommodate different modulation schemes.

Functionality-wise, the modulator needs to take the input data and apply a specific modulation technique. Since the example uses QPSK, I'll include that detail, explaining how it maps binary data to symbols by adjusting both amplitude and phase. The function for mapping will involve converting two bits into one of four possible symbols.

Timing requirements are crucial. The module should operate synchronously with the clock, so all internal operations need to be edge-sensitive. The reset signal should be active-high, meaning when it's high, the module resets its state. I'll also mention that data_in is valid on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring proper synchronization.

I should make sure each section is clearly separated and concise. No extra explanations or markdown—just the facts in a structured format as per the example provided. Also, since the user emphasized including all necessary details for implementation, I'll ensure that the width of inputs and outputs are specified appropriately.

Wait, the user mentioned to provide ONLY the specification without any additional text or explanations. So I need to avoid any further elaboration beyond what's in the code block they showed. That means sticking strictly to the format they outlined: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, Timing Requirements.

I think that covers everything. Let me structure it accordingly, making sure each part is clear and meets the user's requirements.

```  
1. Module Name: DigitalModulator  
2. Description: A digital modulator that encodes binary input data into a modulated output signal using QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) technique.  
3. Inputs:  
   - data_in: 8-bit Binary input data to be modulated.  
   - clk: 1-bit Clock signal for timing operations.  
   - rst: 1-bit Active-high reset signal to initialize the module.  
4. Outputs:  
   - encoded_out: 16-bit Modulated output signal representing the encoded binary data.  
5. Functionality:  
   The DigitalModulator takes an 8-bit binary input and maps it to a QPSK symbol by converting two bits into one of four possible symbols (00, 01, 10, 11). The modulated output is then generated by adjusting the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal based on the mapped symbols.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: Positive-edge triggered synchronous design.  
   - Reset: Active-high reset signal that resets all internal states when asserted.  
   - Data Validity: data_in is valid on the rising edge of the clock.
