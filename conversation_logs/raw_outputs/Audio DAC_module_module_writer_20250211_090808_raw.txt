Okay, I need to create a Verilog module for an 8x8 multiplier that takes two 8-bit inputs and produces a 16-bit output. The user has specified the ports: a (input), b (input), and product (output). 

First, I'll define the module structure with the given name `multiplier` and ports. Since multiplication can be implemented using repeated addition, I'll use a loop to add the multiplicand 'a' shifted by each bit of the multiplier 'b'.

I know that in Verilog, loops are used with the `for` keyword. The loop should run from 0 to 7 (8 iterations) to cover all bits of the 8-bit multiplier.

Inside the loop, I'll compute the shifted value of 'a' by left-shifting it by the current bit index and then ANDing with the corresponding bit of 'b'. This will effectively zero out any bits that aren't set in 'b'.

Then, I'll add this shifted value to an accumulator register `acc` which holds the intermediate product. The accumulation happens only when the corresponding bit in 'b' is 1.

Finally, after all iterations, the accumulated result in `acc` will be the product of 'a' and 'b', which I'll assign to the output `product`.

I need to ensure that all variables are declared correctly and that the loop efficiently computes the product without unnecessary constructs. Using a register for accumulation ensures that each step's result is stored before moving on to the next iteration.

Testing this module with various inputs should confirm its correctness, but the logic seems sound based on repeated addition.

```verilog
module multiplier (
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [15:0] product
);

    reg [15:0] acc;

    always @* begin
        acc = 0;
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i = i + 1) begin
            shifted_a = a << i;
            if (b[i]) begin
                acc = acc + shifted_a;
            end
        end
        product = acc;
    end

endmodule
```
