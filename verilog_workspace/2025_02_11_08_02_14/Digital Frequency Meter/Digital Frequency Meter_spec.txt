Description: A Digital Frequency Meter measures and displays the frequency of an input signal in Hertz (Hz).  

Inputs:  
- clk: 1 bit System Clock (Positive Edge)  
- rst_n: 1 bit Active-Low Reset  
- sig_in: 1 bit Input Signal to measure  

Outputs:  
- seg_dp: 1 bit Segment Common Anode/Digit Enable  
- seg_a: 1 bit Segment A of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_b: 1 bit Segment B of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_c: 1 bit Segment C of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_d: 1 bit Segment D of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_e: 1 bit Segment E of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_f: 1 bit Segment F of the Seven-Segment Display  
- seg_g: 1 bit Segment G of the Seven-Segment Display  
- digit1: 4 bits Most Significant Digit (MSB) of Frequency Value  
- digit2: 4 bits Middle Two Digits of Frequency Value  
- digit3: 4 bits Least Significant Digit (LSB) of Frequency Value  
- dp0: 1 bit Decimal Point Control for First Digit  
- dp1: 1 bit Decimal Point Control for Second Digit  

Functionality:  
The Digital Frequency Meter measures the frequency of the input signal (sig_in) by counting the number of cycles over a fixed time window. The frequency is calculated as count / time_window and displayed in Hz with two decimal places. The module includes:  
- A counter to track the input signal cycles  
- A timer to measure the elapsed time  
- Logic to calculate frequency and update the display  
- Reset functionality to initialize counters and displays  
- Overflow/underflow detection for accurate measurements  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock (clk): 10 ns period  
- Reset (rst_n): Must be held low for at least 100 ns to fully reset the module  
- Synchronization between sig_in and clk: Input signal must be stable for at least 1 ns before the clock edge
