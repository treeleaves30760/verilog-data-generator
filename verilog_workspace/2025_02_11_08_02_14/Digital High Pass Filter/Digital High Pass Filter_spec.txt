2. Description: A digital high pass filter that processes input samples and outputs filtered samples above a specified cutoff frequency.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 1-bit Clock signal
   - rst: 1-bit Reset signal
   - d_in: 16-bit Signed integer Input data sample
4. Outputs:
   - d_out: 16-bit Signed integer Output data sample
5. Functionality:
   The filter processes each input sample and produces an output sample based on the difference equation y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1]. This implementation uses a simple first-order high pass filter structure to attenuate low-frequency components of the input signal while allowing high-frequency components to pass through.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock: Positive-edge triggered synchronous design
   - Reset: Active-high reset that initializes internal states and flip-flops
   - Filter operates synchronously with the clock signal, processing one sample per clock cycle
