2. Description: A digital controller for traffic lights that manages the sequence of green, yellow, and red signals for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 8-bit clock signal (for timing operations)
   - rst: 8-bit active-high reset signal (to initialize the controller)
   - start: 1-bit input to initiate the traffic light sequence
   - pedestrian: 4-bit input indicating pedestrian crossing requests (each bit represents a different phase)
4. Outputs:
   - traffic_light: 3-bit output (R, G, B) for each traffic light (0-7)
   - pedestrian_grant: 1-bit output to indicate when pedestrians can cross
   - violation: 1-bit output to detect any signal violations or illegal states
5. Functionality:
   - Implements a traffic light cycle with the following sequence:
     - Green (G) for 50 clock cycles
     - Yellow (Y) for 10 clock cycles
     - Red (R) for 30 clock cycles
     - Repeat the cycle indefinitely unless interrupted by pedestrian input or reset.
   - Monitors the pedestrian input and grants crossing when:
     - The current traffic light is red.
     - Pedestrian request persists for two full traffic light cycles.
     - Grants are prioritized over vehicular traffic if both start and pedestrian inputs are active simultaneously.
   - Detects signal violations, such as:
     - Simultaneous green and red signals
     - Unintended yellow or red skips in the sequence
     - Outputs a violation flag when any invalid state is detected.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz (10 ns period)
   - Reset (rst): Active high for 100 ns to ensure full initialization
   - All signals are synchronous to the clock edge (rising edge)
