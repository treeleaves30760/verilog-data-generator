Description: A Verilog implementation of an I2C slave device that communicates with an I2C master.  

Inputs:  
- scl: 1-bit input representing the I2C clock line (bidirectional).  
- sda: 1-bit input representing the I2C data line (bidirectional).  

Outputs:  
- scl_out: 2-bit output for driving the SCL line (bit 0: drive enable, bit 1: clock value).  
- sda_out: 2-bit output for driving the SDA line (bit 0: drive enable, bit 1: data value).  

Functionality:  
The I2C slave module implements standard I2C protocol functionality including:  
1. Addressing (7-bit or optional 10-bit and general call addressing).  
2. Data reception from the master when addressed with a read command.  
3. Data transmission to the master when addressed with a write command.  
4. Acknowledgment generation on SDA line during communication.  
5. Handling of start and stop conditions.  

Timing Requirements:  
- The module must adhere to I2C timing specifications, including minimum hold times on SDA after SCL transitions.  
- Clock stretching is supported for Slave acknowledgment (ACK) timing.  

Additional Features:  
- Optional support for 10-bit addressing.  
- Optional support for General Call addressing.  
- Data reception buffer with configurable depth.  
- Interrupt generation upon data reception or transmission completion.  

Control Signals:  
- reset: 1-bit input to reset the module's state machine and internal registers.  
- clk: System clock input for timing operations.  
- data_ready: 1-bit output indicating new data has been received.  
- tx_empty: 1-bit output indicating transmission buffer is empty.  

Interface Protocol:  
- The module adheres to I2C protocol version 2.1 specifications.  
- SCL and SDA lines are tri-stated when not actively driving.
