2. **Provide ONLY the Verilog code**: No explanations or additional text should be included, just the code itself.

3. **Follow module name and ports from the specification exactly**: The module name should be two_to_one_mux, and the ports should match exactly as given (a, b, sel, y).

4. **Include clear comments**: I'll add comments to explain what each part of the code does, making it easier for others to understand.

5. **Use synthesizable constructs only**: The example uses case statements, which are synthesizable, so I'll stick with that approach instead of using if-else statements or other non-synthesizable constructs.

Now, putting this all together, here's how the code should look:
