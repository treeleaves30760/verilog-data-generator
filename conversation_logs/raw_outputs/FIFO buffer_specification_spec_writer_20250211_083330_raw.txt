<think>
Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a FIFO buffer. Let me start by understanding what a FIFO is. FIFO stands for First-In-First-Out, which means data is stored and retrieved in the order it's received. It's commonly used in digital circuits to handle asynchronous data transfers between different parts of a system.

I'll begin by outlining the structure as per the user's instructions. The module name should be something clear like `fifo_buffer`. Next, I need a brief description. Maybe something like "A generic FIFO buffer with read and write operations." That covers its primary function.

Now, moving on to inputs. The FIFO needs control signals for writing and reading. So, I'll include `clk` (clock) and `rst_n` (reset, active low). For the write side, there should be a `wr_en` (write enable) signal and a data input `din` which is typically 1 bit but can be extended. Similarly, on the read side, a `rd_en` (read enable) and data output `dout`. Also, status signals like `full`, `empty`, and `almost_full` are essential for proper operation.

For outputs, besides the data output, I should include flags to indicate when the FIFO is full or empty. These help in managing the read and write operations effectively.

Regarding functionality, the FIFO needs to enqueue data when `wr_en` is high and dequeue when `rd_en` is active. The internal memory can be implemented using a RAM block for efficiency. The status signals should update accordingly: `full` when all slots are filled, `empty` when none are occupied, and `almost_full` when almost all slots are used.

Timing requirements are crucial. The FIFO operates on the rising edge of the clock (`clk`). The reset is active low, meaning it's triggered when `rst_n` is 0. There should be a minimum period between clock edges to ensure stability, so I'll specify a minimum period of 5ns. Setup and hold times for inputs are also important; I'll set them to 1ns each to prevent metastability issues.

I need to make sure all these points are clearly addressed in the specification without using any markdown or code blocks, as per the user's request. The language should be concise and structured, following the format provided earlier.

```
Module Name: fifo_buffer
Description: A generic FIFO buffer with read and write operations.

Inputs:
- clk: 1 bit Clock signal
- rst_n: 1 bit Active low reset signal
- wr_en: 1 bit Write enable signal
- din: W bits Input data (W is the width of the data bus)

Outputs:
- dout: W bits Output data
- full: 1 bit Indicates if the FIFO is full
- empty: 1 bit Indicates if the FIFO is empty
- almost_full: 1 bit Indicates when the FIFO is almost full

Functionality:
The FIFO buffer implements a first-in-first-out memory structure with separate read and write ports. It supports asynchronous read and write operations, controlled by the wr_en and rd_en signals. The internal memory is implemented using a RAM block for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Timing Requirements:
- Clock: clk (rising edge)
- Reset: rst_n (active low)
- Minimum clock period: 5 ns
- Setup time for inputs: 1 ns
- Hold time for inputs: 1 ns
