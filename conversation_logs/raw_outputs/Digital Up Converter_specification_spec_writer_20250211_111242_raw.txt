--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, so I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Up Converter (DUC). Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should understand what a DUC does. From what I remember, a DUC is used in digital communication systems to convert a baseband signal up to a higher frequency band. It's like shifting the signal to a different part of the spectrum so it can be transmitted without interference.

Alright, let's break down the components. The DUC typically takes a complex digital input (like I and Q channels) and converts it into an RF output. So, the inputs would include the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals, each with their own bit widths. Maybe 16 bits for both? That seems common.

Then there's the clock signal. The DUC needs a system clock to operate, so I'll need to define that as an input too. Probably a standard frequency like 100 MHz or something, but since it's a Verilog spec, maybe just specify the width and type, not the actual frequency.

Reset is another important input. It should be a synchronous reset, active high, I think. So when the reset signal is high, the DUC stops whatever it's doing and resets to a known state.

Now for the outputs. The main output would be the RF signal, which is a high-frequency digital output. Maybe 1 bit wide since it's just a single-ended output. Also, there might be some control signals like an empty signal (maybe not necessary here) or a valid signal indicating when the conversion is done.

Functionality-wise, the DUC needs to perform several steps. First, it should take the I and Q inputs, which are complex numbers representing the baseband signal. Then, it multiplies these by a carrier signal to shift them up in frequency. This process is called modulation. So, I'll need to generate the carrier signal, probably using sine and cosine functions.

Wait, how do I handle the carrier generation? Maybe use lookup tables or generate the sine and cosine values on the fly using Verilog code. Also, the DUC might have a variable carrier frequency, so there should be inputs for setting that frequency. That means adding control signals like carrier_freq and maybe a clock for the carrier.

Another thing is the interpolation. Since the baseband signal is at a lower rate than the RF output, we need to upsample it using interpolation filters to avoid aliasing. So, I'll need an interpolator with a certain decimation factor. Maybe 4x or something like that.

The DUC should also handle the digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) for both I and Q paths, but wait, in this case, since we're dealing with digital signals up to the RF stage, maybe the DAC is part of another block. Or perhaps the DUC includes the DAC as part of its functionality. Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's better to focus on the digital processing part here.

So, the steps are: receive I and Q inputs, apply the carrier frequency via multiplication (mixing), upsample using interpolation, then output the RF signal. Also, there might be some filtering involved after mixing to remove unwanted spurs or noise.

Timing requirements are crucial. The DUC should operate synchronously with the system clock. It needs a clock input and a reset. The timing details would include setup times for inputs relative to the clock, and any required hold times. Maybe specify that all synchronous inputs must be stable within one clock cycle after the rising edge of the clock.

Now, putting this together into the Verilog spec format as per the user's instructions. Let me structure it step by step.

1. Module Name: digital_up_converter

2. Description: A Digital Up Converter (DUC) that converts baseband I/Q signals to an RF output by mixing with a carrier signal and interpolating.

3. Inputs:
   - i_signal: 16-bit in-phase input
   - q_signal: 16-bit quadrature input
   - sys_clk: system clock (probably 100 MHz, but just specify as input)
   - reset_n: active high synchronous reset
   - carrier_freq: control signal to set the carrier frequency
   - carrier_clk: clock for generating the carrier signal

4. Outputs:
   - rf_output: 1-bit RF digital output
   - valid: indicates when the conversion is complete (optional, but maybe include)
   
Wait, in the initial example, there was an empty signal as well. Maybe I should include that too to indicate when the DUC is ready for new data.

5. Functionality:
   The DUC takes I and Q inputs, mixes them with a carrier generated from carrier_freq and carrier_clk, interpolates to upsample, filters if necessary, and outputs the RF signal on rf_output. It asserts empty when it's ready for new data and valid when conversion is done.

6. Timing Requirements:
   - Operated synchronously by sys_clk
   - Synchronous reset via reset_n (active high)
   - All inputs must be stable within one clock cycle after the rising edge of sys_clk

Wait, in the initial example, there was a lot more detail about the carrier generation and interpolation. Maybe I should include that as part of the functionality.

Also, considering the user's request to provide all necessary details for implementation, perhaps adding specifics like the number of taps for the interpolator or the method of carrier generation (like using sine/cosine tables) would be helpful.

But since it's a specification, maybe keep it high-level without getting into too much implementation detail. Just outline the main functions and interfaces.

I think I've covered all the necessary parts. Now, let me structure this according to the user's format.
