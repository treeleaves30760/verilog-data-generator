Okay, so I need to create a comprehensive testbench for a 2-bit full-adder in Verilog. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I remember that a full-adder takes three inputs: A, B, and C_in, and produces two outputs: S (sum) and C_out (carry). Since it's a 2-bit adder, each input can be either 0 or 1.

I think the testbench should cover all possible combinations of A, B, and C_in. There are 2^3 = 8 possible cases. I'll need to simulate each case and check if the outputs match what they're supposed to be.

I also remember that in Verilog testbenches, we usually generate a clock signal. So I'll need an always block for the clock, maybe with a period of 10 ns. Then, there's the initial block where I set up the inputs and check the outputs.

Wait, how do I handle the C_out? Oh right, in a full-adder, C_out is generated when A + B + C_in exceeds 1, so it's like a carry-over to the next higher bit.

I should also include some success or failure messages. Maybe after each test case, I can print whether the outputs are correct or not. If all cases pass, I'll display a success message; otherwise, an error with details.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create the clock signal.
2. Initialize the inputs A, B, and C_in in the initial block.
3. For each combination of A, B, and C_in (0-7), set the inputs at time t, then wait for a positive edge of the clock to ensure the outputs have stabilized.
4. Calculate the expected sum and carry based on the inputs.
5. Compare the actual outputs with the expected values. If they match, print success; else, print failure with the test case details.
6. After all cases are tested, display an overall result.

I need to make sure that each input is set correctly before the clock's positive edge so that the DUT (device under test) has time to process it. Also, after setting the inputs, I should wait for a couple of clock periods to ensure stability before checking the outputs.

Wait, in the code example provided earlier, there was an issue with the C_out not being calculated correctly for some cases. How do I handle that? Let me think about how the full-adder works:

The sum S is A XOR B XOR C_in.
The carry C_out is (A AND B) OR (A AND C_in) OR (B AND C_in).

So, in each test case, I can compute these values and compare them with the DUT's outputs.

I should also make sure that the testbench includes all possible input combinations. Let me list them:

0: A=0, B=0, C_in=0
1: A=0, B=0, C_in=1
2: A=0, B=1, C_in=0
3: A=0, B=1, C_in=1
4: A=1, B=0, C_in=0
5: A=1, B=0, C_in=1
6: A=1, B=1, C_in=0
7: A=1, B=1, C_in=1

Each of these should be tested in the initial block.

I think I've got a good plan. Now, let me structure the code accordingly.

```verilog
module tb_full_adder_2bit;
    // Clock generation
    always begin
        clock = 0;
        #5ns;
        clock = 1;
        #5ns;
    end

    initial begin
        // Reset signals and inputs
        a = 0;
        b = 0;
        c_in = 0;
        
        $display("Starting full adder testbench...");
        success = 1;

        // Test all combinations of A, B, C_in (0 to 7)
        for (test_case = 0; test_case < 8; test_case++) begin
            {a, b, c_in} = test_case;
            
            // Wait for positive edge of clock to ensure setup
            @(posedge clock);
            wait(2ns);  // Allow some propagation delay
            
            // Calculate expected sum and carry
            sum_expected = (a ^ b ^ c_in);
            carry_expected = (a & b) | (a & c_in) | (b & c_in);

            // Compare actual outputs with expected values
            if (sum != sum_expected || carry_out != carry_expected) begin
                $display("Failure: Test case %d", test_case);
                $display("A=%d, B=%d, C_in=%d", a, b, c_in);
                $display("Expected S=%d, C_out=%d; Actual S=%d, C_out=%d",
                         sum_expected, carry_expected, sum, carry_out);
                success = 0;
            end
        end

        // Final test result
        if (success) begin
            $display("\nAll test cases passed successfully!");
        end else begin
            $display("\nTestbench failed. See above for details.");
        end
        
        // Stop simulation after testing
        #1ns;
        $stop;
    end

    // DUT ports
    input a, b, c_in;
    output sum, carry_out;

    // Clock signal
    wire clock;
    
    // Reset signal (not used in this testbench)
    wire reset;

endmodule
