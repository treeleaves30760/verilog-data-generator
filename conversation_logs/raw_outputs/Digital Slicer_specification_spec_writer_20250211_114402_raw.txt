<think>
Okay, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Slicer based on the user's example. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I should understand what a Digital Slicer does. From what I know, it's a circuit that takes an analog input and slices it into digital levels, probably using a reference voltage. So the main function is to compare the analog input with a threshold and output a digital signal when the input crosses that threshold.

Looking at the example provided, the module name was "digital_slicer". It had inputs like clk (clock), rst_n (reset), vin (analog input), vref (reference voltage), and an output dout. The functionality involved comparing vin with vref and producing a digital pulse when they cross.

I need to structure my specification similarly but ensure all necessary details are included. Let me break it down step by step.

1. **Module Name**: I'll name it "digital_slicer" as in the example.

2. **Description**: A brief overview, like "Digital Slicer that converts an analog input into a digital output based on a reference voltage."

3. **Inputs**:
   - clk: Clock signal, typically 1 bit.
   - rst_n: Active-low reset, 1 bit.
   - vin: Analog input voltage, but in Verilog, it's often represented as a wire without bits, so maybe specify as "analog" type or just leave it as is.
   - vref: Reference voltage for slicing, similar to vin.

4. **Outputs**:
   - dout: Digital output, 1 bit, which is the sliced signal.

5. **Functionality**: 
   - The slicer compares vin with vref continuously.
   - When vin crosses above vref, it triggers a pulse on dout.
   - The pulse width can be set by the user via pulse_width CONTROL input, allowing for adjustable timing.

6. **Timing Requirements**:
   - Clock:clk is essential as operations are synchronous.
   - Reset:rst_n for initializing states.
   - Pulse Width Control: Maybe an input like pulse_width that sets how long the output stays high after crossing.

Wait, in the example, there was no mention of pulse width control. But to make it more detailed, adding a feature where the user can set the duration of the digital pulse would be beneficial. So I'll include that as an optional input or maybe a parameter.

I should also consider how the slicing is implemented. Typically, this might involve sampling vin at each clock edge and comparing it with vref. If the difference between vin and vref exceeds a certain threshold, then the output is triggered for one clock cycle or based on pulse_width.

Another consideration: Handling metastability? Probably not necessary in a basic spec, but ensuring that the circuit is robust against input variations is important.

I should also think about the edge cases. For example, what happens if vin oscillates around vref rapidly? The output should ideally only trigger once per crossing, not multiple times due to noise.

In terms of implementation, the module will likely use a comparator, some flip-flops for state management, and logic to control the pulse width based on the input parameters.

I need to make sure all these points are covered in the specification clearly. Let me structure it step by step as per the user's format.

1. Module Name: digital_slicer  
2. Description: Digital Slicer that converts an analog input into a digital output based on a reference voltage.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Active-low Reset signal  
   - vin: Analog Input voltage (no width specified)  
   - vref: Reference voltage for slicing (no width specified)  
4. Outputs:  
   - dout: 1 bit Digital Output indicating when the input crosses the reference voltage  
5. Functionality:  
   The Digital Slicer continuously compares the analog input (vin) with the reference voltage (vref). When vin exceeds vref, it generates a digital pulse on dout. The pulse width can be adjusted using the pulse_width control input to set the duration of the output signal.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk operates at a specified frequency (e.g., 100 MHz)  
   - Reset: rst_n initializes all internal states to a known condition upon assertion  
   - Pulse Width Control: The pulse_width input determines the duration of the digital output pulse after crossing the reference voltage.
