Okay, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 digital signal selector based on the given specifications. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the module is called sel_4to1. It has four data inputs D0 to D3, two select inputs S[1] and S[0], a clock Clk, a reset Rst_n, and an output Y.

The functionality is straightforward: based on the binary value of S, it selects one of the four inputs. For example, when S is 00 (binary), it selects D0, and so on.

Looking at the testbench provided, I notice that the module uses a clock with a period of 20ns, which means each rising edge is every 20ns. The reset is active high, meaning Rst_n should be 1 to release from reset.

I need to make sure the design meets the timing requirements: setup time is 1ns and hold time is 2ns relative to the clock. This suggests that all inputs should be stable for at least 1ns before the rising edge of Clk, and remain for 2ns after it.

Since the module needs to handle synchronous operations, I'll use a D-type flip-flop to capture the input values on each clock edge. The flip-flop will ensure that the data is stable during setup and hold times.

The selection logic can be implemented using a case statement based on the two select bits S[1] and S[0]. Alternatively, a multiplexer could be used, but a case statement might be more readable here.

I should also consider the reset functionality. When Rst_n is 0 (active high), all outputs should default to a safe state, probably 0.

Putting it together, I'll structure the module as follows:

1. Define the inputs and outputs with their respective data types.
2. Use a D-type flip-flop to capture the input values on each clock edge when not in reset.
3. Implement the selection logic using a case statement based on S.
4. Ensure that during reset, Y is 0.

I'll also need to handle the asynchronous reset correctly, making sure it resets the flip-flop immediately, regardless of the clock.

Now, I'll write the Verilog code, making sure to include comments for clarity and follow synthesizable constructs only. The code should be directly usable in a simulator without any issues.

```verilog
module sel_4to1;
    // Inputs
    input Clk;          // Clock signal
    input Rst_n;        // Reset signal (active high)
    input D0;           // Data input 0
    input D1;           // Data input 1
    input D2;           // Data input 2
    input D3;           // Data input 3
    input [1:0] S;      // Select control (2 bits)

    // Output
    output Y;           // Selected output

    // Internal signals
    reg y_reg;
    reg [1:0] s_reg;

    // Flip-flop to capture inputs synchronously
    DFF ff (
        .clk(Clk),
        .rst(~Rst_n),  // Active low reset for D-type FF
        .d({D3, D2, D1, D0}),  // All data inputs concatenated
        .q(s_reg)       // Store the select and data in s_reg
    );

    // Synchronous selection logic
    always @(posedge Clk or negedge Rst_n) begin
        if (~Rst_n) begin
            y_reg <= 0;
        end else begin
            case (s_reg)
                2'b00: y_reg = D0;
                2'b01: y_reg = D1;
                2'b10: y_reg = D2;
                2'b11: y_reg = D3;
                default: y_reg = 0;  // Default to 0 if S is invalid
            endcase
        end
    end

    // Output the selected value
    assign Y = y_reg;

endmodule

// Define a simple D-type flip-flop for internal use
module DFF;
    input clk;
    input rst;
    input d;           // Data input (can be multiple bits)
    output reg q;       // Registered output

    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
        if (~rst) begin
            q <= 0;
        end else begin
            q <= d;
        end
    end
endmodule
