Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-bit counter that increments on each rising edge of the clock. The user has specified certain requirements: it must be efficient and correct, follow their guidelines, and include clear comments.

First, I'll start by understanding the basic structure of a Verilog module. I know that modules have inputs and outputs defined at the top, followed by the logic inside. For a counter, I typically need a clock input (clk), a reset button (rst), and the output (count_out).

The user mentioned using D-Flip-Flops (DFFs) for each bit of the 4-bit counter. That makes sense because each flip-flop can store one bit, and together they form a 4-bit register to hold the current count value.

I should define a DFF module inside the main counter module. This will encapsulate the flip-flop behavior. The DFF needs a clock input (clk), a data input (d), and a reset input (rst). It will have a Q output that holds the state.

In the main module, I'll instantiate four DFFs, each dedicated to one bit of the 4-bit counter. Each flip-flop's data input will be controlled by the current count value and the next state logic.

The next step is to handle the increment operation. Since it's a 4-bit counter, I need to manage the carry-over when the count reaches 15 (binary 1111). After that, it should reset to 0. So, I'll compute the next value by adding 1 to the current count and then checking for overflow.

I'll use a wire to hold the incremented value (next_val) and another to detect if all bits are 1s (all_ones). If all_ones is true, the counter resets; otherwise, it increments normally.

For the DFF module, I need to ensure that during reset, the flip-flop's output is 0. The user specified using a conditional assignment for the Q output based on the rst signal.

Putting it all together, I'll connect each bit of the count_out to the corresponding DFF's Q output. The control logic will manage the increment and reset operations efficiently.

I should also include clear comments in the code to explain each part, especially where the next_val is computed and how the overflow is handled. This makes the code more understandable for someone reviewing it later.

Finally, I'll make sure that all signals are properly declared as wires or reg variables. The clock is an input wire, while internal signals like count_out and next_val should be registers to hold their state correctly.

I think that covers all the necessary steps. Now, I can write the Verilog code following these guidelines.

```verilog
// 4-bit counter module with rising edge increment on clock
module four_bit_counter (
    input wire clk,
    input wire rst,
    output reg [3:0] count_out
);

    // D-Flip-Flop (DFF) macro to create a simple flip-flop
    // This is used for each bit in the 4-bit counter
    `define DFF(clk, rst, d, q) \
        always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin \
            if (rst) q <= 0; \
            else       q <= d; \
        end

    // Instantiate four DFFs for each bit of the 4-bit counter
    reg [3:0] count;
    
    // Create a DFF for each bit of the counter
    `DFF(clk, rst, count[0], count_out[0])
    `DFF(clk, rst, count[1], count_out[1])
    `DFF(clk, rst, count[2], count_out[2])
    `DFF(clk, rst, count[3], count_out[3])

    // Compute the next value of the counter
    wire [3:0] next_val;
    wire all_ones;

    // Check if all bits are 1 (overflow condition)
    assign all_ones = (count == 4'b1111);

    // Calculate next value, reset if overflow
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin
            count <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (all_ones) begin
                count <= 0;
            end else begin
                count <= count + 1;
            end
        end
    end
