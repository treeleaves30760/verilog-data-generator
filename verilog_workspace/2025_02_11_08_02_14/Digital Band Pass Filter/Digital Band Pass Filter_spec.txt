2. Description: A second-order Butterworth band pass filter with tunable center and bandwidth frequencies.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal
   - rst: 1-bit reset signal
   - d_in: 16-bit input data
4. Outputs:
   - d_out: 16-bit filtered output
   - valid: 1-bit flag indicating valid output
5. Functionality: The filter passes signals within a specified frequency range, using delay elements and adders for computation.
6. Timing Requirements: Clock-driven, reset functionality, setup time after reset.
