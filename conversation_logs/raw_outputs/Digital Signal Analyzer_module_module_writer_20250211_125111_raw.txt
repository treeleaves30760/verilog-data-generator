Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 2-to-1 multiplexer. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a multiplexer selects between two inputs based on a control signal. So the module should have two input ports (let's say in0 and in1), a control port (s), and an output port (out).

I need to define the module with the correct number of bits. Since it's 2-to-1, each input is a single bit. So the ports will be:
- Input: in0 (bit), in1 (bit)
- Control: s (bit)
- Output: out (bit)

Next, I should write the Verilog code inside the module. The output depends on the control signal. If s is 0, out should be in0; if s is 1, out should be in1.

I can use a simple conditional assignment:
out = (s == 0) ? in0 : in1;

Wait, but in Verilog, I think it's better to use an if-else statement for clarity and synthesis. So maybe:

always @(*) begin
    if (s == 0) begin
        out <= in0;
    end else begin
        out <= in1;
    end
end

That should work. Also, I need to declare the ports at the beginning of the module.

Putting it all together, the module will have an input for s, in0, in1, and an output for out. The code inside will handle the selection based on the control signal.

I think that's all. Let me write the code accordingly.

```verilog
module mux_2to1 (
    input wire s,
    input wire in0,
    input wire in1,
    output wire out
);

always @(*) begin
    if (s == 0) begin
        out <= in0;
    end else begin
        out <= in1;
    end
end

endmodule
```
