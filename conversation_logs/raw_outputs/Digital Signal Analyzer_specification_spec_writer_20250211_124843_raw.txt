Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Analyzer based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of how they want the specifications structured. They mentioned including Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. So I should follow that format closely.

The module name is "digital_signal_analyzer". The description needs to be brief but informative, so I'll mention it's for processing and analyzing digital signals in applications like debugging or testing.

Looking at the inputs, there are several key ones: clock (clk), reset (rst), data_in, valid_in, and trigger_source. Each has a specific width and purpose. For example, clk is 1 bit, rst is also 1 bit with an active high signal. Data_in is N bits wide, representing the digital signal. Valid_in indicates if data_in is valid each cycle.

For outputs, I see data_out, which is N bits, and control signals like analyze_done, trigger_flag, error_flag, and config_ready. These help in managing the analyzer's operations and reporting statuses.

The functionality section needs to outline what the module does step by step. It should capture the signal, detect triggers, perform analysis tasks like FFT or filtering, manage configuration, report errors, and handle data output.

Timing requirements include a clock frequency range (I chose 50MHz-100MHz as a common range), reset polarity, trigger detection timing, and FIFO full conditions. These are crucial for proper operation and synchronization.

I should ensure all parts are clear and detailed without extra explanations, sticking to the structure provided. The user emphasized not using markdown or code blocks beyond the initial request, so I'll format it simply as specified.

Finally, I need to make sure that each section is concise but comprehensive enough for implementation purposes. This way, engineers can refer to the spec easily when designing the Verilog module.

1. Module Name: digital_signal_analyzer  
2. Description: A digital signal analyzer module designed to process and analyze digital signals in real-time. It captures input data, detects triggers, performs analysis tasks such as frequency measurement, and generates output results.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit (System clock)  
   - rst: 1 bit (Active-high reset signal)  
   - data_in: N bits (Digital signal input to be analyzed)  
   - valid_in: 1 bit (Indicates if data_in is valid for the current clock cycle)  
   - trigger_source: M bits (External trigger signal or source for triggering analysis operations)  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: N bits (Processed and analyzed output data)  
   - analyze_done: 1 bit (Indicates completion of analysis operation)  
   - trigger_flag: 1 bit (Flag indicating a trigger event has been detected)  
   - error_flag: 1 bit (Indicates if an error condition has occurred during analysis)  
   - config_ready: 1 bit (Indicates that the analyzer is ready for configuration updates)  
5. Functionality:  
   - Captures digital signals from data_in and stores them in internal memory for processing.  
   - Detects trigger events based on trigger_source and valid_in signals.  
   - Performs analysis operations such as frequency measurement, peak detection, and filtering.  
   - Generates output results in data_out and sets corresponding flags (analyze_done, trigger_flag, error_flag).  
   - Supports configuration updates via config_ready signal.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: 50 MHz to 100 MHz  
   - Reset: Active-high reset with a hold time of at least 3 clock cycles.  
   - Trigger detection: Must be detected within 2 clock cycles after trigger_source assertion.  
   - Analysis operations must complete within a specified timeframe, typically determined by the input data rate and analysis complexity.
