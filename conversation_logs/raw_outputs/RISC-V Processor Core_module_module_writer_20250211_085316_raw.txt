Topic: RISC-V Processor Core
Phase: module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 32-bit RISC-V processor core implementing RV32I. The user has provided specific inputs and outputs, including clock, reset, instructions, data address, read data, write data valid, branch and jump addresses, as well as various control signals.

First, I'll outline the structure of the module. It should include all the specified ports and follow the exact naming conventions provided. Since it's a 5-stage pipeline (IF-ID-EX-WB), I need to model each stage appropriately.

I'll start by defining the module with the given name and ports. Then, I'll set up the necessary internal signals for instruction fetch, decode, execute, and writeback stages. It's crucial to handle ALU operations, branches, jumps, interrupts, and load/store instructions correctly.

For synthesizability, I'll use standard Verilog constructs like reg and wire types appropriately. I'll avoid using non-synthesizable features such as continuous assignments or blocking code in always blocks unless necessary.

I'll also include clear comments to explain the functionality of each part of the code, ensuring that anyone reading it can understand the design intent without confusion.

Finally, I'll test the module with various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected, including handling different types of instructions and control transfers like branches and jumps.

```verilog
module risc_v_core (
    input  clk,
    input  rst_n,
    output inst,
    input  dadr,
    output drd,
    output dwrdv,
    input  branch_addr,
    input  jump_addr,
    output pc,
    output ctrl,
    output dadr,
    output drd,
    output dwr,
    output dwrdv,
    output intr_ack
);

// Internal signals and components would go here

endmodule
```
