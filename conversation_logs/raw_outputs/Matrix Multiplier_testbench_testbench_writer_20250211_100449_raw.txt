Alright, I need to create a testbench for the Matrix Multiplier as per the user's specifications. The matrix is 8x8 with 16-bit elements each, and the result is a 32-bit vector.

First, I'll start by setting up the Verilog module for the testbench. I'll name it `tb_matrix_multiplier`. Inside this module, I'll instantiate the Matrix_Multiplier as the DUT (Device Under Test).

Next, I need to generate a clock signal. I'll create an always block that toggles the clock every 10 nanoseconds.

Then, there's the reset signal. I'll initialize it to 1 for a short duration to ensure the DUT starts in a known state.

The start signal will be used to initiate the matrix multiplication process. I'll assert this after releasing the reset.

For matrices A and B, I'll create 8x8 arrays with each element being a 16-bit vector. To test all combinations, I'll initialize these matrices with specific patterns or random data.

The output matrix C will be checked after the multiplication completes. I'll use display statements to verify each element of C against expected results.

I'll also need to handle the done signal. Once it's asserted, the testbench can proceed to check the outputs and then finish.

Including clear success/failure messages is crucial for quick debugging. I'll use SystemVerilog functions like $error and $fatal to indicate when tests pass or fail.

Finally, I'll compile the testbench and simulate it using a Verilog simulator to verify that all tests pass as expected.
