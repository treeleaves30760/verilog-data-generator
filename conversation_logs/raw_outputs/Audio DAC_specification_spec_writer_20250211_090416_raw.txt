Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for an Audio DAC. Let me break down what I know and how to approach this.

First, understanding the components: A Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) takes a digital input and converts it into an analog output, which is essential for audio processing. The key here is accuracy and timing because audio quality depends on precise conversion and synchronization with the clock.

I'll start by outlining the module name as "audio_dac." Next, the description should briefly mention its purpose: converting digital samples to analog signals suitable for audio systems.

For inputs, I need to consider the digital audio data. Typically, this is a stream of bits, so an input like "digital_audio_in" with a certain width makes sense. Maybe 16 or 24 bits since those are common in audio applications. Also, a clock signal is crucial for timing, so including "clk" as an input is necessary. A reset signal ("rst") is also important to ensure proper initialization.

On the output side, the primary output will be the analog voltage generated by the DAC. Let's name it "audio_out" with a width of 1 bit since it's a single-ended output. Additionally, including a digital-to-analog conversion complete signal ("dac_done") as an output can help in synchronization with other parts of the system.

Now, detailing the functionality: The DAC should sample the digital input at each clock edge and convert it to an analog voltage. It's important that this process is synchronized with the system clock for accurate timing. Also, when the reset signal is active, the DAC should halt conversion and possibly output a default value like 0.

Regarding timing requirements, the clock will dictate the sampling rate. Common audio sample rates include 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, etc., so specifying that the clock frequency should match one of these makes sense. The reset signal is typically active-low, meaning it's asserted when the signal is low, and it should hold for at least two clock cycles to ensure a clean reset.

I also need to think about any additional details. For instance, the DAC might have internal registers or FIFOs to handle data streaming, but since this is a basic specification, I'll keep it simple unless specified otherwise. Also, considering the interface with other components like ADCs or microcontrollers would be important for integration, but that's beyond the current scope.

Putting it all together, I need to structure each section clearly without markdown, using line breaks and indentation as per the user's request. Ensuring each part is concise yet informative will make the specification useful for implementation.

1. Module Name: audio_dac
2. Description: Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for audio signal generation.
3. Inputs:
   - digital_audio_in: 16 [Digital audio sample input]
   - clk: 1 [System clock]
   - rst: 1 [Active-low reset signal]
4. Outputs:
   - audio_out: 1 [Analog output voltage]
   - dac_done: 1 [Digital-to-analog conversion complete signal]
5. Functionality:
   The Audio DAC converts the digital audio input into an analog output. It samples the digital_audio_in at each rising edge of the clock (clk). The conversion is synchronized with the system clock, and the output voltage corresponds to the digital value of digital_audio_in. When rst is active (low), the DAC resets all internal states and stops conversion until rst is released.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock: clk operates at a frequency matching common audio sample rates (e.g., 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz).
   - Reset: rst must be held low for at least two clock cycles to ensure proper initialization.
