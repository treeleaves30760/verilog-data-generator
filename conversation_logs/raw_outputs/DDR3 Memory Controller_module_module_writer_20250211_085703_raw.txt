Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for an 8-bit multiplier based on the provided testbench and specifications. Let me start by understanding what's required.

First, looking at the testbench, it has inputs clk, rst_n, a (8 bits), b (8 bits), and output product (16 bits). The testbench generates all possible combinations of a and b, so my module must handle 8x8 multiplication correctly.

I'll need to design a multiplier that takes two 8-bit numbers and outputs their product as a 16-bit number. Since the testbench checks each combination, I should ensure that the multiplier is correct for all cases.

The module name in the testbench is Multiplier, so my Verilog code must have the same module name with the specified ports.

I'll start by setting up the module structure. The multiplier can be implemented using a single 16-bit register to store the product. Since multiplication is straightforward, I don't need complex state machines unless there are timing requirements, but in this case, it's a simple combinatorial calculation.

Wait, no, actually, since the testbench applies inputs with setup time and checks outputs with hold time, I should ensure that the multiplier has proper clocking. So, I'll use a D flip-flop to capture the input values on the rising edge of the clock.

So, the steps are:

1. Create a D flip-flop for each input (a and b) to capture their values on the rising edge of clk.
2. Multiply the captured a and b values in the next cycle.
3. Store the result in a register so it's available at the output with proper hold time.

I'll need to handle reset correctly, ensuring that when rst_n is low (active), the product is 0.

Let me outline the code:

- Use two D flip-flops for a and b. The outputs of these will be the values used in multiplication.
- On each rising edge of clk, if not reset, multiply the current a and b.
- Store the result in a register that's updated every clock cycle.

I should also ensure that the product is correctly calculated as an 8x8 multiplication, which can be up to 16 bits. So, I'll use a 16-bit wire or reg for the product.

Putting it all together:

- The module will have clk and rst_n as inputs.
- a and b are 8-bit inputs, so I'll need to capture them using flip-flops.
- The product is a 16-bit output, which should be updated each clock cycle based on the current a and b values.

I think that's all. Now, I'll write the Verilog code accordingly, making sure to include comments for clarity.

```verilog
module Multiplier (
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    input [7:0] a,
    input [7:0] b,
    output reg [15:0] product
);
    
    // Internal signals
    reg [7:0] a_reg;
    reg [7:0] b_reg;

    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (~rst_n) begin
            a_reg <= 0;
            b_reg <= 0;
            product <= 0;
        end else begin
            a_reg <= a;
            b_reg <= b;
            product <= (a_reg * b_reg);
        end
    end

endmodule
