Description: A hardware implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) optimized for edge computing applications.  

Inputs:  
- clk: 1-bit Clock signal  
- rst: 1-bit Reset signal (active high)  
- input_data: 784-bit Input image data (28x28 pixels, grayscale)  
- start: 1-bit Start signal to initiate processing  

Outputs:  
- output_class: 10-bit Output class prediction (one-hot encoded)  
- done: 1-bit Signal indicating completion of processing  

Functionality:  
The CNN core implements a simplified version of LeNet-5 for MNIST digit classification. It includes the following layers:  
1. Convolutional Layer with 4 kernels, each of size 5x5, producing 4 feature maps.  
2. ReLU activation function applied to the output of convolution.  
3. Max pooling layer with pool size 2x2 and stride 2.  
4. Fully connected layer with 16 neurons followed by another fully connected layer with 10 neurons (output classes).  
5. Softmax activation for final classification.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock frequency: 100 MHz  
- Reset polarity: Active high  
- Processing time per input image: Less than 1 ms  

The module processes input images in a pipelined manner, with each layer operating asynchronously to improve throughput. The design assumes fixed-point arithmetic for efficient hardware implementation and minimal resource usage.
