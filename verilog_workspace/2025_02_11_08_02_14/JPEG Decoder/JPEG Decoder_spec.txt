Okay, I need to create a Verilog specification for a JPEG decoder based on the user's example and their request. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for.

First, the user provided an example of a specification for a JPEG Decoder with detailed sections: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. They want me to create something similar but without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text in a structured format.

I should make sure each section is clear and follows the structure they outlined. Let's go through each part step by step.

1. **Module Name**: Straightforward, it's "JPEG Decoder".

2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the module does. The example mentions decoding JPEG-compressed images into uncompressed formats like RGB or YCbCr. I should keep this concise but informative.

3. **Inputs**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal, 1 bit.
   - `rst_n`: Active-low reset, 1 bit.
   - `jpeg_data`: Input data from the compressed image, typically a bus with a certain width (like 8 bits for each byte).
   - `jpeg_valid`: Indicates if the input data is valid, 1 bit.
   - `h_sync`: Horizontal synchronization signal, 1 bit.
   - `v_sync`: Vertical synchronization signal, 1 bit.

4. **Outputs**:
   - `rgb_data`: The decoded RGB pixel, probably a bus (e.g., 24 bits for 8-bit RGB).
   - `rgb_valid`: Indicates if the output data is valid, 1 bit.
   - `decode_done`: Signal when decoding is complete, 1 bit.

5. **Functionality**:
   I need to describe what the decoder does in stages. The example lists parsing JPEG headers, quantization, inverse DCT, and reconstruction. I should outline each step clearly but without too much detail.

6. **Timing Requirements**:
   - Clock: 100 MHz (user's example had this).
   - Reset: Positive pulse to reset the state machine.
   - Synchronization: How h_sync and v_sync are used for frame timing.

I also need to ensure that each input and output is clearly defined with their widths. For instance, `jpeg_data` might be a bus like 8 bits wide if handling standard JPEG data bytes. The RGB data would likely be 24 bits (8 bits per channel).

In the functionality section, I should mention the main steps without diving into too much technical detailâ€”just enough to outline the process.

For timing, specifying the clock frequency and reset condition is important for implementation. Also, noting that h_sync and v_sync are used for frame synchronization helps in understanding how these signals are utilized.

I need to avoid any markdown or code blocks as per the user's instruction. So, I'll present each section with bullet points where necessary but keep it plain text.

Let me structure this out:

1. Module Name: JPEG Decoder
2. Description: A brief description of decoding JPEG images into RGB or YCbCr.
3. Inputs:
   - clk (1 bit)
   - rst_n (1 bit)
   - jpeg_data (bus width, e.g., 8 bits)
   - jpeg_valid (1 bit)
   - h_sync (1 bit)
   - v_sync (1 bit)
4. Outputs:
   - rgb_data (bus width, e.g., 24 bits)
   - rgb_valid (1 bit)
   - decode_done (1 bit)
5. Functionality: Steps involved in decoding, from header parsing to outputting RGB data.
6. Timing Requirements: Clock frequency, reset, and synchronization signals.

I should make sure each part is concise but covers all necessary details for someone implementing the decoder in Verilog.

Module Name: JPEG Decoder  
Description: A hardware implementation of a JPEG image decoder that converts compressed JPEG data into uncompressed RGB or YCbCr pixel data.  

Inputs:  
- `clk`: 1-bit clock signal  
- `rst_n`: 1-bit active-low reset signal  
- `jpeg_data`: W-bit input data bus for the JPEG-compressed image (e.g., W=8)  
- `jpeg_valid`: 1-bit signal indicating valid input data  
- `h_sync`: 1-bit horizontal synchronization signal  
- `v_sync`: 1-bit vertical synchronization signal  

Outputs:  
- `rgb_data`: D-bit output data bus for the decoded RGB pixel (e.g., D=24)  
- `rgb_valid`: 1-bit signal indicating valid output data  
- `decode_done`: 1-bit signal indicating completion of decoding  

Functionality:  
The JPEG Decoder processes input data according to the JPEG standard, including:  
1. Parsing JPEG headers (SOI, DQT, DHT, etc.)  
2. Decoding quantization tables and Huffman codes  
3. Performing inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) for each macroblock  
4. Reconstructing pixel values using inverse quantization  
5. Converting from YCbCr color space to RGB (if required)  
6. Synchronizing output with h_sync and v_sync signals  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock: 100 MHz  
- Reset: Positive pulse on rst_n for proper initialization  
- Synchronization: h_sync and v_sync are used to align decoded pixels with display timing
