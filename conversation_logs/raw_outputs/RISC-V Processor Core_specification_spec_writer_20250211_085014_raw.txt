Topic: RISC-V Processor Core
Phase: specification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Alright, so I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a RISC-V Processor Core based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for and how to approach this.

First, the user provided an example of a previous response where they specified a module named "riscv_core" with various inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. They want the new specification in the same clear format without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text within a code block.

I should start by identifying all the necessary components of a RISC-V processor core. The example included clock (clk), reset (rst_n), instructions (inst), and data-related signals like read address, write address, read data, write data, and write valid. Also, control signals like branch and jump addresses (branch_addr, jump_addr) and interrupt-related signals were present.

Next, the outputs included program counter (pc), control signals (ctrl), data address (dadr), data read (drd), data write (dwr), data write valid (dwrdv), and interrupt acknowledge (intr_ack). These cover the essential parts of a processor's interaction with memory and control units.

For functionality, I need to describe how the core fetches instructions, decodes them, executes operations including ALU functions, branch/jump handling, interrupt management, and data memory access. It's important to mention that it's a 32-bit core, which aligns with standard RISC-V specifications.

Timing requirements are crucial for proper operation. The core should function on the rising edge of the clock (clk), with asynchronous reset via rst_n. Synchronous writes to memory ensure data integrity, and interrupt handling must be synchronized as well.

I also need to consider any additional details that might be necessary for implementation, such as pipeline stages or specific instruction sets supported, but since the user didn't specify, I'll stick to a general overview.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the specification with clear sections: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. Each input and output should have their name, width, and description. The functionality section needs to be concise yet comprehensive enough for someone to understand how each part works.

I should make sure not to include any unnecessary explanations or markdown formatting as per the user's instructions. Just a straightforward, clear specification that can guide the implementation of the RISC-V processor core in Verilog.

```  
1. Module Name: riscv_core  
2. Description:  
   A 32-bit RISC-V processor core implementing the RV32I instruction set architecture.  

3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Asynchronous reset active low  
   - inst: 32 bits Instruction memory read data  
   - dadr: 32 bits Data address (AXI)  
   - drd: 32 bits Data read (AXI)  
   - dwrdv: 1 bit Data write valid (AXI)  
   - branch_addr: 32 bits Branch address from the instruction decode stage  
   - jump_addr: 32 bits Jump address from the instruction decode stage  

4. Outputs:  
   - pc: 32 bits Program counter output  
   - ctrl: 16 bits Control signals (ALU control, register file control)  
   - dadr: 32 bits Data memory write address  
   - drd: 32 bits Data read data  
   - dwr: 32 bits Data write data  
   - dwrdv: 1 bit Data write valid  
   - intr_ack: 1 bit Interrupt acknowledge  

5. Functionality:  
   The RISC-V core executes instructions from the RV32I instruction set. It includes an instruction fetch stage, decode stage, and execute stage. The core supports arithmetic and logical operations (ALU), branch/jump instructions, interrupt handling, and load/store operations to memory. The processor uses a 5-stage pipeline: IF-ID-EX-WB.  

6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): Positive edge triggered synchronous design  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active low asynchronous reset  
   - Synchronous write operations to memory (dwrdv) must be aligned with the clock edge  
   - Interrupts are handled in the EX stage and require synchronized acknowledgment
