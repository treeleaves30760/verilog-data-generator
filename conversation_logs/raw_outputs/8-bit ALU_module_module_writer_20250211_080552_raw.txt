Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should recall what a multiplexer does. A 4-to-1 mux takes four input signals and two control signals (since 2^2 = 4), and it selects which of the four inputs is passed to the output based on the combination of the control signals.

The user provided a code example for a 2-to-1 multiplexer, but I need to adjust that for a 4-to-1 version. The module name should be `mux4to1`, with four input ports (a, b, c, d), two selection ports (sel0 and sel1), and one output port y.

I remember that in Verilog, the selection can be implemented using a combination of conditional statements or logical operations. Using an if-else chain might be more readable for someone new to digital design, but it could also be done with a case statement or even a ternary operator for more complex selections.

Looking at the example code for the 2-to-1 mux, they used a ternary operator: `y = sel ? b : a;`. For the 4-to-1 version, I'll need to extend this logic. Since there are two control bits, sel0 and sel1, I can use their values to determine which input is selected.

I should make sure that all port declarations are correct. The module starts with `module mux4to1 (` and lists the ports in the specified order: a, b, c, d, sel0, sel1, y. All are single bits.

Including comments is important for clarity. I'll add a comment explaining what the module does and how it works. This helps anyone reading the code understand its purpose without confusion.

I also need to ensure that only synthesizable constructs are used. The if-else structure is fine because it's supported in synthesis. No blocking assignments or other non-synthesizable features should be present here.

Testing this module would involve checking all possible combinations of a, b, c, d and sel0, sel1. There are 4 inputs and 2 controls, leading to 8 possible combinations. For each combination, y should equal the corresponding input based on the selection bits.

I think that's all. The code seems straightforward, but I need to make sure it's correctly formatted and follows the user's guidelines precisely.

```verilog
// 4-to-1 Multiplexer Module
// This module selects between four input signals based on two control signals (sel0 and sel1).
module mux4to1 (
    input wire a,   // Input 0
    input wire b,   // Input 1
    input wire c,   // Input 2
    input wire d,   // Input 3
    input wire sel0, // Most significant selection bit (control signal)
    input wire sel1, // Least significant selection bit (control signal)
    output wire y   // Output of the multiplexer
);
    // The if-else chain is used to select between a, b, c, d based on sel0 and sel1.
    // sel0 and sel1 form a 2-bit binary number where:
    // 00 selects a, 01 selects b, 10 selects c, 11 selects d
    if (sel0 == 0 && sel1 == 0) begin
        y = a;
    end else if (sel0 == 0 && sel1 == 1) begin
        y = b;
    end else if (sel0 == 1 && sel1 == 0) begin
        y = c;
    end else if (sel0 == 1 && sel1 == 1) begin
        y = d;
    end
endmodule
