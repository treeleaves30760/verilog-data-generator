2. Description: Digital Slicer that converts an analog input into a digital output based on a reference voltage.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Active-low Reset signal  
   - vin: Analog Input voltage (no width specified)  
   - vref: Reference voltage for slicing (no width specified)  
4. Outputs:  
   - dout: 1 bit Digital Output indicating when the input crosses the reference voltage  
5. Functionality:  
   The Digital Slicer continuously compares the analog input (vin) with the reference voltage (vref). When vin exceeds vref, it generates a digital pulse on dout. The pulse width can be adjusted using the pulse_width control input to set the duration of the output signal.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk operates at a specified frequency (e.g., 100 MHz)  
   - Reset: rst_n initializes all internal states to a known condition upon assertion  
   - Pulse Width Control: The pulse_width input determines the duration of the digital output pulse after crossing the reference voltage.
