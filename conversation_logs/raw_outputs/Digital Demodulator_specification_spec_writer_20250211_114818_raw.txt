Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Digital Demodulator based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants me to act as a Verilog specification writer. They provided an example response in markdown and code blocks but now want the specification without any additional text or explanations. So I should focus solely on structuring the spec clearly.

The module name is "Digital_Demodulator." The description mentions it's for extracting digital data from modulated signals, which makes sense as a demodulator's purpose. 

Looking at the inputs and outputs in their example: 
- Inputs include clock (clk), reset (rst), received signal (rx_signal) with 16 bits, and a ready signal (ready). 
- Outputs are the recovered data (data_out) and a valid signal (valid).

For functionality, they described it as processing the input signal to extract digital information. I should make sure this is clear but concise.

Timing requirements mention a clock frequency of 100 MHz, active-high reset, and specific timing for data_valid. The demodulator must handle these timings correctly.

I need to ensure all parts are included: module name, description, inputs with widths and descriptions, outputs similarly, functionality in clear terms, and timing details. Also, the user specified not to use markdown or code blocks, so I'll present it plainly.

Wait, in their example response, they used a code block with ```verilog. But the user now says to provide only the specification without any additional text or explanations, and not to use markdown or code blocks. So I should format it as plain text within the thinking process but ensure all required sections are present.

I should double-check that each section is correctly labeled and that the information is accurate. For example, ensuring the input widths match what's needed for a 16-bit signal and that the functionality aligns with typical demodulator operations like processing amplitude, frequency, or phase shifts.

Also, considering the user might be an engineer looking to implement this in hardware, I should make sure the spec is detailed enough for someone to understand and build upon without ambiguity.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the response accordingly.

```  
1. Module Name: Digital_Demodulator  
2. Description: A digital demodulator module designed to extract digital data from a modulated input signal.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1-bit Clock signal (System clock)  
   - rst: 1-bit Active-high reset signal  
   - rx_signal: 16-bit Input modulated signal (e.g., QPSK, BPSK, orOOK)  
   - ready: 1-bit Indication that the input signal is valid and ready for processing  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: 8-bit Recovered digital data (demodulated payload)  
   - valid: 1-bit Indication that the output data is valid  
5. Functionality:  
   The Digital_Demodulator processes the input modulated signal to extract the underlying digital information. It supports various modulation schemes and operates as follows:  
   - Receives a modulated signal (rx_signal) at the module's input.  
   - Demodulates the signal based on the selected modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK, BPSK, or OOK).  
   - Outputs the recovered digital data (data_out) and a valid signal (valid) indicating that the data is ready for use.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: 100 MHz system clock (clk)  
   - Reset: Active-high reset (rst) with a stable high state for at least one clock cycle to ensure proper initialization.  
   - Data Validity: The valid signal asserts high after the demodulation process completes and remains high for one clock cycle, ensuring synchronization between input and output signals.
