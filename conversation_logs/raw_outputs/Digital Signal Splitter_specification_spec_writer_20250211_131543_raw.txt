Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Splitter based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user mentioned that I should act as a Verilog specification writer. So, my role is clear: provide a structured and detailed spec. They emphasized using a specific format without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text within a code block.

Looking at their example response, it's organized into sections: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. I should follow this structure precisely to meet their expectations.

The user wants the specification for a Digital Signal Splitter. From what I know, such a splitter takes an input signal and routes it to multiple output channels based on some control signals. So, the functionality involves selecting which of the outputs gets the input signal at any given time.

I'll start with the Module Name: "digital_signal_splitter". That's straightforward.

Next, the Description should briefly explain what the module does. It should mention that it splits a digital signal into multiple output channels based on control inputs.

For Inputs:
- The main input is 'input_data' which is 1 bit wide.
- Control signals are needed to determine where the data goes. Let's say we have four outputs, so two bits for 'channel_select' (since 2^2 =4). I'll include a reset signal as well, which is typically active low, so named 'rst_n' and also 1 bit.

Outputs:
- There should be four output channels: ch0, ch1, ch2, ch3. Each is 1 bit wide.

Functionality-wise, the splitter will pass the input_data to only one channel at a time based on the channel_select. If all select bits are 0, maybe none get the signal, or perhaps it defaults to one channel. I'll note that only one output is active at any time to avoid conflicts.

Timing Requirements: The module needs a clock, so 'clk' is an input with no width specified. Reset is 'rst_n', which is active low. The setup and hold times are important for metastability, so I'll include those as comments in the spec.

I should make sure each section is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary explanations since they only want the specification without extra text. Also, ensure that all necessary details are included for someone to implement this module correctly.

```  
1. Module Name: digital_signal_splitter  
2. Description: A module that splits a single digital signal into multiple output channels based on control signals.  
3. Inputs:  
   - input_data: 1 bit [The digital signal to be split]  
   - channel_select: 2 bits [Control signal to determine the output channel (00, 01, 10, 11)]  
   - rst_n: 1 bit [Active low reset signal]  
4. Outputs:  
   - ch0: 1 bit [Output channel 0]  
   - ch1: 1 bit [Output channel 1]  
   - ch2: 1 bit [Output channel 2]  
   - ch3: 1 bit [Output channel 3]  
5. Functionality:  
   The module routes the input_data to one of four output channels based on the channel_select control signal. Only one output channel is active at any given time. If all select bits are 0, no channel will receive the input data.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk (input)  
   - Reset: rst_n (active low)  
   - Setup Time: 1 clock cycle before reset assertion  
   - Hold Time: 1 clock cycle after reset de-assertion
