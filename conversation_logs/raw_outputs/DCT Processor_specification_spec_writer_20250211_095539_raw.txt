Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) processor. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I should understand what a DCT is and how it's used in digital signal processing. The DCT is commonly used in image and video compression, like in JPEGs and MPEGs, so this processor will likely be part of a codec or something similar.

The user provided an example specification for the DCT Processor, which includes module name, description, inputs, outputs, functionality, and timing requirements. I need to follow that structure but make sure all details are accurate and necessary for implementation.

Let me break down each section:

1. **Module Name**: Straightforward, it's "dct_processor".

2. **Description**: A brief overview of what the module does. The example mentions 8x8 matrix processing with quantization support. I should include similar details but ensure they're accurate. Wait, is an 8x8 DCT standard? Yes, commonly used in many codecs.

3. **Inputs**:
   - `clk`: Clock signal, width 1 bit.
   - `rst_n`: Active-low reset, width 1 bit.
   - `start`: Trigger to begin processing, 1 bit.
   - `data_in`: The input matrix data, probably a bus with enough bits for each element. Since it's an 8x8 matrix and assuming 8-bit elements, maybe 64 bits? Or perhaps more if there are multiple words. Wait, the example uses 512 bits for data_in, which makes sense if each of the 64 elements is 8 bits (64*8=512). So that's correct.

   - `quantization_table`: A bus with a predefined width, maybe 64 bits as well. Each element would be the quantizer value.

4. **Outputs**:
   - `done`: Indicates processing completion, 1 bit.
   - `data_out`: The transformed coefficients, same structure as data_in but after DCT and quantization. So also 512 bits.

5. **Functionality**: The example lists steps like receiving input matrix, applying DCT, quantizing, etc. I need to make sure each step is clear. Also, the processor should handle multiple matrices sequentially, which makes sense for continuous processing.

6. **Timing Requirements**: Clock frequency, reset polarity, and how many clock cycles it takes to process one matrix. The example mentions 1024 cycles, which seems reasonable but depends on the implementation's efficiency.

Wait, I should double-check some details. For instance, the input data_in is a single bus of 512 bits. That might be challenging in terms of memory if each element is 8 bits, as it would require handling 64 elements. Alternatively, maybe the data is provided sequentially, but the example seems to present it as a single burst.

Also, the quantization table is another input, which makes sense because different standards use different tables. So including that as an input allows flexibility.

In terms of functionality, after applying DCT and quantization, the output is sent via data_out. The processor should be able to handle multiple matrices back-to-back once started, so it's efficient in processing without idle time between matrices.

I also need to consider the reset polarity. The example uses rst_n as active-low, which is standard in Verilog designs. So that's correct.

For timing, a clock frequency of 100 MHz is reasonable for many FPGA applications, but the actual value might vary based on the target hardware. Processing one matrix in 1024 cycles at 100MHz would take about 10.24 microseconds per matrix, which seems acceptable for typical video frame rates.

I should also ensure that all inputs and outputs are properly defined with their widths and descriptions so that someone implementing this module can easily connect the signals without confusion.

Another point is whether to include any control signals beyond start and done. The example doesn't mention interrupt requests or other status flags, but maybe it's sufficient for a basic processor.

I think I've covered all the necessary sections and details based on the example provided. Now, I'll structure this into the required format without any additional explanations.
