Description: A generic FIFO buffer with read and write operations.

Inputs:
- clk: 1 bit Clock signal
- rst_n: 1 bit Active low reset signal
- wr_en: 1 bit Write enable signal
- din: W bits Input data (W is the width of the data bus)

Outputs:
- dout: W bits Output data
- full: 1 bit Indicates if the FIFO is full
- empty: 1 bit Indicates if the FIFO is empty
- almost_full: 1 bit Indicates when the FIFO is almost full

Functionality:
The FIFO buffer implements a first-in-first-out memory structure with separate read and write ports. It supports asynchronous read and write operations, controlled by the wr_en and rd_en signals. The internal memory is implemented using a RAM block for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Timing Requirements:
- Clock: clk (rising edge)
- Reset: rst_n (active low)
- Minimum clock period: 5 ns
- Setup time for inputs: 1 ns
- Hold time for inputs: 1 ns
