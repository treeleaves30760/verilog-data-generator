Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Traffic Light Controller based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what they're asking for. They want the specification structured in a specific way without any markdown or extra explanations.

First, I'll outline the sections required: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. Each section needs to be clear and concise. 

For the Module Name, it's straightforward—just "Traffic_Light_Controller."

Next, the Description should briefly explain what the module does. It controls traffic lights with a cycle of green, yellow, red, and repeats. I'll make sure to mention that it handles pedestrian crossings as well.

Now, moving on to Inputs. The user specified four inputs: clk (8-bit clock), rst (8-bit reset), start (1-bit to initiate the sequence), and pedestrian (4-bit for crossing requests). Wait, 8 bits for clock and reset? That seems a bit unusual since clocks are typically single bits. Maybe they meant it's an 8-bit signal, but in Verilog, we usually use a single bit for such purposes. I'll proceed as per the query.

Outputs include four traffic lights (each with 3 bits for R, G, B), pedestrian_grant (1-bit), and violation (1-bit). That makes sense to indicate when it's safe for pedestrians and if there's any signal violation.

Functionality is crucial here. The controller needs a cycle of green → yellow → red → green, each lasting specific durations. I'll outline the timings: 50 cycles for green, 10 for yellow, and 30 for red. Also, when pedestrian is detected, it should switch to pedestrian_grant after two full cycles. If both pedestrian and start are high, pedestrian takes priority.

I need to include a violation signal if any unexpected state occurs. That adds safety to the system.

For Timing Requirements, I'll specify that the clock runs at 100 MHz, reset is active high with a duration of 100 ns, and all signals are synchronous to the clock. This provides clear timing constraints for implementation.

I should ensure that each section is well-defined without any unnecessary details. The user emphasized clarity and structure, so I'll avoid technical jargon where possible and make sure each part is easily understandable.

Wait, the pedestrian input is 4 bits—does that mean it can handle multiple crossings? Maybe each bit represents a different crossing phase. But since the output is a single grant bit, perhaps it's an OR of all four inputs. I'll note that in the description to clarify.

Also, considering the violation detection, I need to make sure that any state not part of the predefined sequence triggers this signal. That includes invalid transitions or unexpected states during operation.

I think I've covered all the necessary parts as per the user's request. Now, I'll structure it without using markdown, keeping each section separated by line breaks and ensuring clarity.

```
1. Module Name: Traffic_Light_Controller
2. Description: A digital controller for traffic lights that manages the sequence of green, yellow, and red signals for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 8-bit clock signal (for timing operations)
   - rst: 8-bit active-high reset signal (to initialize the controller)
   - start: 1-bit input to initiate the traffic light sequence
   - pedestrian: 4-bit input indicating pedestrian crossing requests (each bit represents a different phase)
4. Outputs:
   - traffic_light: 3-bit output (R, G, B) for each traffic light (0-7)
   - pedestrian_grant: 1-bit output to indicate when pedestrians can cross
   - violation: 1-bit output to detect any signal violations or illegal states
5. Functionality:
   - Implements a traffic light cycle with the following sequence:
     - Green (G) for 50 clock cycles
     - Yellow (Y) for 10 clock cycles
     - Red (R) for 30 clock cycles
     - Repeat the cycle indefinitely unless interrupted by pedestrian input or reset.
   - Monitors the pedestrian input and grants crossing when:
     - The current traffic light is red.
     - Pedestrian request persists for two full traffic light cycles.
     - Grants are prioritized over vehicular traffic if both start and pedestrian inputs are active simultaneously.
   - Detects signal violations, such as:
     - Simultaneous green and red signals
     - Unintended yellow or red skips in the sequence
     - Outputs a violation flag when any invalid state is detected.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz (10 ns period)
   - Reset (rst): Active high for 100 ns to ensure full initialization
   - All signals are synchronous to the clock edge (rising edge)
