2. Description: An 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs basic arithmetic and bitwise operations.  
3. Inputs:  
   - A: 8 input operands for arithmetic/logic operations.  
   - B: 8 input operands for arithmetic/logic operations.  
   - op_mode: 2 control signals to select between arithmetic or logic operations.  
   - rst: 1-bit reset signal (active high).  
   - clk: 1-bit clock signal.  
4. Outputs:  
   - result: 8-bit output of the ALU operation.  
   - z: 1-bit zero flag indicating if the result is zero.  
   - co: 1-bit carry out from the most significant bit during addition.  
   - ov: 1-bit overflow flag for subtraction and addition operations.  
   - n: 1-bit negative flag indicating if the result's sign bit is set.  
5. Functionality:  
   The ALU supports the following operations based on op_mode:  
   - Arithmetic Operations: Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, XOR.  
   - Logic Operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT (for single operand).  
   Status flags are updated accordingly:  
   - z is set if result == 0.  
   - co is set for addition overflow beyond 8 bits.  
   - ov is set for subtraction underflow or addition overflow.  
   - n reflects the sign bit of the result.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   The ALU operates synchronously with a clock (clk). All operations complete within one clock cycle after stable inputs. Reset (rst) initializes internal states and outputs to a known state.
