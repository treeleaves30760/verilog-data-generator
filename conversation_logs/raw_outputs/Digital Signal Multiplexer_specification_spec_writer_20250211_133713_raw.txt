Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a 4-to-1 digital signal multiplexer. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I should understand what a multiplexer is. A multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational circuit that selects one of multiple input signals and forwards it to the output based on a control signal. In this case, it's a 4-to-1 MUX, meaning there are four data inputs and two selection lines (since 2^2 = 4).

I'll start by outlining the structure as per the user's request. The specification should include Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements.

For the Module Name, it's straightforward: "digital_signal_multiplexer".

In the Description, I need to briefly explain what the module does. It should mention that it selects one of four input signals based on a 2-bit control signal.

Next are the Inputs. There will be four data inputs (D0 to D3), each with a width of 1 bit and a description indicating they're data inputs. Then, two selection lines (S0 and S1), each also 1 bit wide, which control which input is selected. I should note that S1 is the most significant bit.

The Outputs section will have one output (Y) that's 1 bit wide, representing the selected data.

Under Functionality, I need to clearly describe how the multiplexer operates. It should explain that based on the combination of S0 and S1, the corresponding D input is passed to Y. For example, when S1=0 and S0=0, D0 is selected; when S1=0 and S0=1, D1 is selected, and so on.

For Timing Requirements, since this is a combinational circuit without clocked flip-flops, there's no need for a clock or reset. The outputs will change as soon as the inputs settle, so I'll note that the critical timing parameter is the propagation delay from inputs to output.

I should make sure each section is concise and follows the specified format without any markdown or extra explanations. Also, ensure all necessary details are included for proper implementation.

1. Module Name: digital_signal_multiplexer  
2. Description: A 4-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of four input signals based on a 2-bit control signal.  
3. Inputs:  
   - D0: 1 bit Data Input 0  
   - D1: 1 bit Data Input 1  
   - D2: 1 bit Data Input 2  
   - D3: 1 bit Data Input 3  
   - S0: 1 bit Selection Line 0 (Least Significant Bit)  
   - S1: 1 bit Selection Line 1 (Most Significant Bit)  
4. Outputs:  
   - Y: 1 bit Output Signal  
5. Functionality:  
   The multiplexer selects one of the four data inputs (D0-D3) based on the two selection lines (S0 and S1). The output (Y) is determined as follows:  
   - When S1=0 and S0=0, Y = D0  
   - When S1=0 and S0=1, Y = D1  
   - When S1=1 and S0=0, Y = D2  
   - When S1=1 and S0=1, Y = D3  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - The output (Y) will propagate within the specified delay after all inputs stabilize.
