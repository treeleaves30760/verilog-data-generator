Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Combiner based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user mentioned that I should act as a Verilog specification writer. So, my role is clear: provide a structured and detailed spec. They want it formatted in a specific way without any markdown or code blocks, just plain text within a code block.

Looking at their example response, they included sections like Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. I should follow that structure closely to meet their expectations.

The user emphasized including all necessary details for implementation. That means I need to be thorough in each section. For the Inputs and Outputs, specifying the width and description is crucial. In the Functionality section, I should outline how the combiner works step by step.

I also notice they included Timing Requirements with clock, reset, and setup/tolerance details. This suggests that synchronization aspects are important for the design's reliability.

Since the user provided an example response, it gives me a template to follow. I'll make sure each section is clear and concise, avoiding any unnecessary explanations beyond what's needed for implementation.

I should also consider potential edge cases or timing issues, like metastability with asynchronous inputs, but perhaps that's beyond the current scope unless specified. For now, adhering to the structure and including all required details as per their example should suffice.

Finally, I'll ensure the language is professional yet clear, avoiding any jargon that might confuse someone implementing the design.

```  
1. Module Name: digital_signal_combiner  
2. Description: A module that combines multiple digital signals into a single output based on specific rules and conditions.  
3. Inputs:  
   - in1: 1 bit Description: First input signal  
   - in2: 1 bit Description: Second input signal  
   - in3: 1 bit Description: Third input signal  
   - enable: 1 bit Description: Enable signal to activate the combiner  
4. Outputs:  
   - out: 1 bit Description: Combined output signal  
5. Functionality:  
   The combiner module takes three input signals (in1, in2, in3) and an enable signal. When the enable signal is high, the module performs the following operations:  
   - If any of the input signals is high (1), the output will be high (1).  
   - If all input signals are low (0), the output will remain low (0).  
   - The output is updated on each rising edge of the clock signal.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: clk 1 bit, active-high clock signal with a frequency of 50 MHz  
   - Reset: rst_n 1 bit, active-low reset signal that resets all internal states when asserted  
   - Setup Time: All inputs must be stable for at least 1 ns before the rising edge of the clock  
   - Hold Time: All inputs must remain stable for at least 1 ns after the rising edge of the clock
