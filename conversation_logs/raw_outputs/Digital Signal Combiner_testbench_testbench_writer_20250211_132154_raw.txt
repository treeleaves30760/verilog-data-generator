Alright, I need to create a comprehensive testbench for a 4-to-1 multiplexer in Verilog. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I'll follow them carefully.

First, the testbench must be wrapped in ```verilog blocks and include only Verilog code. It should generate a clock signal, test all input combinations, and provide clear success or failure messages without any explanations.

The 4-to-1 multiplexer has four data inputs (A, B, C, D), two address lines (S0 and S1) to select the input, and an output (Y). The selection is done based on the binary address provided by S0 and S1. For example, when S0=0 and S1=0, Y should equal A; when S1=1 and S0=0, Y equals B, and so on.

Since there are two address lines, there are 4 possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), leading to 16 total input combinations (each of the four data inputs can be 0 or 1). I'll need to simulate all these cases to ensure the multiplexer works correctly.

I'll start by defining the module tb_mux4to1 with inputs for A, B, C, D, S0, S1, Y, and Clk. The clock generation will be handled within the testbench using an always block that toggles the clock every 5 time units.

At the beginning, I'll reset all inputs to 0 and wait for a few clock cycles to ensure the circuit is in a known state before starting the tests. Then, I'll loop through all possible combinations of S1, S0, C, B, A. For each combination, I'll set the respective inputs, wait half a clock period, and check if Y matches the expected value based on the address lines.

If any test case fails, I'll display an error message indicating which specific case failed. If all tests pass, I'll show a success message.

I need to make sure that the testbench is self-contained and doesn't reference any external modules. Using $display for messages will help in verifying the results during simulation.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define the module tb_mux4to1 with inputs A, B, C, D, S0, S1, Y, and Clk.
2. Generate the clock signal within the testbench using an always block.
3. Reset all inputs to 0 at the start and wait for a few clock cycles.
4. After reset, iterate through all possible combinations of S1, S0, C, B, A (total 16 cases).
5. For each combination:
   a. Set A, B, C, D, S0, S1 values.
   b. Wait for half the clock period to allow outputs to stabilize.
   c. Determine the expected Y value based on the address lines.
   d. Check if Y matches the expected value; if not, display an error message.
6. If all tests pass, display a success message.

I should structure the code with nested loops for S1, S0, C, B, A to cover all combinations. The expected Y is determined by decoding the address lines and selecting the corresponding data input.

Testing each combination ensures that all parts of the multiplexer function correctly under various conditions. This thorough testing will help catch any potential issues early in the design phase.
