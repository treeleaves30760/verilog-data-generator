Okay, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer based on the given specifications. The goal is to ensure that the module correctly selects one of four data inputs (D0-D3) based on two selection lines (S0 and S1). 

First, let's understand the functionality required:

- When S1=0 and S0=0, Y should be equal to D0.
- When S1=0 and S0=1, Y should be equal to D1.
- When S1=1 and S0=0, Y should be equal to D2.
- When S1=1 and S0=1, Y should be equal to D3.

This means the selection is controlled by a 2-bit binary address formed by S1 (most significant bit) and S0 (least significant bit). The combination of these two bits determines which data input is selected.

In Verilog, I can implement this using a case statement within an always block. The case statement will check the value of {S1, S0} and assign Y accordingly.

Now, considering the testbench provided, it seems to be generating all possible combinations of inputs and verifying that the output matches the expected value for each combination. This ensures comprehensive testing of the multiplexer functionality.

I need to make sure that the Verilog code is efficient, correct, and adheres strictly to the specified module name and ports. I'll also ensure that only synthesizable constructs are used, avoiding any non-synthesizable features like loops or functions that aren't allowed in combinational logic.

Finally, I'll structure the code with clear comments to make it understandable for anyone reviewing it.

```verilog
module mux4to1 (
    input D0, D1, D2, D3,
    input S0, S1,
    output Y
);
    
    // This module selects one of four inputs based on 2-bit control signals S1 and S0
    always @(*) begin
        case ({S1, S0})  // Combine S1 (MSB) and S0 (LSB) into a 2-bit address
            2'b00: Y = D0;  // Select D0 when S1=0, S0=0
            2'b01: Y = D1;  // Select D1 when S1=0, S0=1
            2'b10: Y = D2;  // Select D2 when S1=1, S0=0
            2'b11: Y = D3;  // Select D3 when S1=1, S0=1
        endcase
    end
    
endmodule
