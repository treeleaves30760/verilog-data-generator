Phase: specification

<think>
Alright, I need to create a detailed Verilog specification for a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM). Let me start by understanding what a PWM is and its key components.

A PWM is used to control power to a load by varying the pulse duration of a digital signal. It's commonly used in motor speed controllers or LED dimmers. The main parts are a counter, comparator, and logic for generating the output pulse based on the reference and duty cycle.

First, I'll outline the module name as pwm_modulator. Next, the description should briefly explain its purpose. 

For inputs, I need:
-clk: the system clock.
-rst: active-high reset signal.
-duty_cycle: an input that sets the desired duty cycle in percentage (e.g., 0 to 100).
-ref_period: defines the reference period for the modulated pulses.

Outputs will include:
-pwm_out: the actual pulse width modulated output, a digital signal.
 pwm_done: indicates when one modulation cycle is complete.

In functionality, I'll describe how the module counts cycles using an internal counter. It compares this count to the duty_cycle and ref_period to generate the PWM signal. The output starts high for the duration of duty_cycle and goes low until the reference period ends, then repeats.

Timing requirements are crucial. The clock is a standard 100MHz, with a reset that takes effect on the falling edge of rst. The pwm_done signal should be valid within one clock cycle after the end of each pulse.

I'll make sure to structure this information clearly without any markdown or code blocks, keeping it concise and easy to understand for implementation.

```  
1. Module Name: pwm_modulator  
2. Description: A Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) that generates a digital output signal with adjustable duty cycle based on input parameters.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit System clock input  
   - rst: 1 bit Active-high reset signal  
   - duty_cycle: 8 bits Duty cycle value (0% to 100%)  
   - ref_period: 8 bits Reference period for pulse generation  
4. Outputs:  
   - pwm_out: 1 bit Pulse width modulated output signal  
   - pwm_done: 1 bit Indicates completion of a modulation cycle  
5. Functionality:  
   The PWM generator operates as follows:  
   - Generates a digital pulse with variable width based on the duty_cycle input.  
   - Compares an internal counter to the duty_cycle and ref_period values.  
   - Outputs a high signal for (duty_cycle / 100) * ref_period time, then switches to low until the next cycle starts.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock frequency: 100 MHz  
   - Reset is active-high; takes effect on falling edge of rst.  
   - pwm_done signal asserts high within one clock cycle after completion of each modulation cycle.
