Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 2-to-1 multiplexer based on the user's request. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that a 2-to-1 MUX has two input data lines and one control line that selects which data is passed to the output. The basic structure would involve using a switch-case statement or if-else conditions to choose between the two inputs based on the control signal.

The user specified the module name as `mux_2to1` with three ports: `in0`, `in1`, and `sel`. The outputs should be assigned to `out`.

I need to make sure that the Verilog code is efficient and correct. Using a switch statement might be more efficient in terms of code readability, especially if there are multiple cases. Since there's only two cases here (sel being 0 or 1), an if-else structure could also work fine.

Wait, but in Verilog, using a case statement can sometimes lead to better synthesis results because it's more explicit about the conditions. So maybe I should go with that approach.

I'll start by defining the module with the specified ports. Then, inside the always block, I'll use a case statement where if `sel` is 0, the output is `in0`, and if `sel` is 1, it's `in1`. 

I should also include comments to make the code clear, explaining each part briefly.

Let me double-check the syntax. The module declaration looks correct with the specified ports. The always block is sensitive to changes in `sel`, which is appropriate since that's the control signal.

I think this implementation is synthesizable and efficient because it directly maps to a simple combinatorial circuit without any unnecessary logic.

```verilog
// 2-to-1 Multiplexer Module
// This module selects between two input signals based on the selection control signal
module mux_2to1 (
    input wire sel,   // Selection control (0: in0, 1: in1)
    input wire in0,   // First data input
    input wire in1,   // Second data input
    output wire out   // Output selected from in0 or in1
);

    always @ (sel) begin
        case (sel)
            0: out = in0;  // When sel is 0, output in0
            1: out = in1;  // When sel is 1, output in1
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```
