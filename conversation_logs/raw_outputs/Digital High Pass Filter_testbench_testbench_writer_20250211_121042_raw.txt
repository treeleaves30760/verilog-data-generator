Okay, I need to create a Verilog testbench for the digital high pass filter based on the given specifications. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the filter has inputs: clk, rst, and d_in. The outputs are d_out. The functionality is defined by the difference equation y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1], which means each output sample is the current input minus the previous one. This is a first-order high pass filter.

The testbench needs to cover all possible input combinations, include clock generation, and provide success/failure messages. I should follow the user's instructions to wrap code in ```verilog blocks and only provide Verilog code without explanations.

I'll start by setting up the module structure. The testbench will have a clk generator with a 10ns period, as that's common for simulations. The rst signal is active-high, so I'll initialize it to 1 for a few clock cycles before releasing it.

Next, I need to generate test inputs. Since d_in is a 16-bit signed integer, I should cover various cases: positive, negative, zero, and both the limits of the 16-bit range. Using an iterative loop with i from -32768 to 32767 makes sense because that's the full range for a 16-bit signed integer.

I'll use $display to print each input value and wait one clock cycle after each iteration to ensure the DUT processes the sample correctly. After processing all samples, I'll display a success message; if any failure occurs during simulation (like unexpected output), I'll show an error.

I should also handle the reset properly. The rst signal will be high for two clock cycles to ensure all flip-flops are initialized before testing begins.

Finally, I need to compile the necessary files using $readmemh for any initialization if needed, but in this case, since it's a simple filter without memory, maybe it's not required. However, including it as a placeholder is good practice.

Putting it all together, the testbench will generate the clock, reset the DUT, iterate through all possible input values, and check each output for correctness.

```verilog
`timescale 1ns / 1ps

module tb_high_pass_filter;
    // Defineclk period
    parameter CLK_PERIOD = 10ns;

    // Generate clock signal
    clk_gen #(.PERIOD(CLK_PERIOD)) clk_inst (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst)
    );

    // DUT instance
    high_pass_filter dut (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .d_in(d_in),
        .d_out(d_out)
    );

    // Clock generation module
    always #(CLK_PERIOD/2) clk = ~clk;

    initial begin
        rst = 1;
        d_in = 0;
        #5ns; rst = 0;
        $readmemh("high_pass_filter.v", dut.mem); // Replace with actual memory contents if needed
    end

    // Test input generation
    integer i;
    initial begin
        for (i = -32768; i <= 32767; i++) begin
            d_in = i;
            #10ns;
            $display("Input: %d", i);
            #10ns;
        end
        $display("Testbench completed successfully!");
    end

    // Monitor output
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst == 0) begin
            $display("Output: %d", d_out);
        end
    end

    // Error checking
    initial begin
        forever begin
            #20ns;
            if ($test$failed()) begin
                $error("Simulation failed!");
            end
        end
    end
