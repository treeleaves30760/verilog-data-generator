Okay, so I need to create a testbench for a 2-bit full adder in Verilog. Hmm, where do I start? Well, first, I remember that a full adder takes three inputs: A, B, and C_in, and produces two outputs: S (sum) and C_out (carry out). Since it's a 2-bit adder, each of these inputs can be either 0 or 1.

I think the testbench should cover all possible input combinations. There are 3 inputs, so that's 2^3 = 8 different cases to test. I'll need to simulate each case and check if the outputs match what they're supposed to be.

I also remember that in Verilog, a testbench usually includes clock generation. So I'll need an always block that generates a clock signal, toggling every certain period. Maybe 10 ns for each cycle?

Then, I should reset the inputs at the beginning. So I'll have a reset signal that's active high, maybe for the first 20 ns to cover two clock cycles.

After the reset, I can loop through all possible input combinations. For each iteration, I'll assign values to A, B, and C_in, wait for one clock period, then check if S and C_out are correct. If they are, print a success message; otherwise, fail.

I should also include some delays so that the outputs have time to settle after changing inputs. Using #1 before checking might be sufficient.

Wait, how do I generate all possible combinations? Maybe using a for loop with i from 0 to 7, and then calculating A, B, C_in based on the binary representation of i. For example, if i is 0, A=0, B=0, C_in=0; if i is 1, A=0, B=0, C_in=1; and so on.

I also need to make sure that after all tests are done, I print a message indicating the testbench has finished successfully. If any test fails, it should display an error immediately.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Create the module tb_full_adder.
2. Inside, declare the inputs A, B, C_in and outputs S, C_out.
3. Generate a clock with period 10 ns.
4. Reset signal for initial setup.
5. Loop through all 8 input combinations.
6. For each combination, assign A, B, C_in based on i.
7. Wait for one clock cycle to let the circuit respond.
8. Check if S and C_out match expected values.
9. Print pass or fail message accordingly.
10. After all loops, print testbench completion.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the Verilog code following these steps, making sure to include all necessary parts like the clock, reset, and the loop with test cases.

```verilog
module tb_full_adder();
    // Inputs
    reg A;
    reg B;
    reg C_in;

    // Outputs
    wire S;
    wire C_out;

    // Clock generation
    always begin
        #5; 
        clock = ~clock;
    end

    initial begin
        clock = 0;
        #10;
        {A, B, C_in} = 0;
        #1;
        if (S != 0 || C_out != 0) $error("Initial state failed");
        
        for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
            A = (i >> 2) & 1;
            B = (i >> 1) & 1;
            C_in = i & 1;
            
            #1;
            if ((S != (A ^ B ^ C_in)) || 
                (C_out != ((A & B) | (A & C_in) | (B & C_in)))) begin
                $error("Test case %d failed", i);
            end else begin
                $display("Test case %d passed", i);
            end
        end
        
        #1;
        $display("All test cases passed");
    end

endmodule
