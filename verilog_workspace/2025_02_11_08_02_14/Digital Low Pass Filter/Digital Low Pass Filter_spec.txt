2. Description: A 2nd-order Butterworth Digital Low Pass Filter (DLPF) designed to attenuate frequencies above a specified cutoff frequency.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst: 1 bit Active-high synchronous reset  
   - data_in: 16 bits Input digital audio sample  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: 16 bits Filtered output digital audio sample  
5. Functionality:  
   The DLPF processes each input sample to produce an output sample based on a recursive difference equation:  
   y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n-1] + b2 * x[n-2] - a1 * y[n-1] - a2 * y[n-2]  
   where:  
   - b0 = 0.5*( (sqrt(3)+1)/ (sqrt(3)+2) ) ≈ 0.4899  
   - b1 = 0.5*( (sqrt(3)-1)/ (sqrt(3)+2) ) ≈ 0.1736  
   - b2 = 0.5*(1/(sqrt(3)+2)) ≈ 0.0748  
   - a1 = 0.9356  
   - a2 = 0.3020  
   The filter operates on signed 16-bit integer samples and maintains internal state variables to track previous inputs and outputs for recursive computation.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 48 kHz system clock  
   - Reset (rst): Active-high synchronous reset, all internal states are cleared upon assertion  
   - Data processing is synchronized with the rising edge of the clock signal
