Okay, I need to create a Verilog module based on the given specifications and testbench. Let me break down what's required.

First, the module name is `digital_diff`. It has inputs: data_in, clk, rst, and outputs diff_out, valid. The functionality involves capturing consecutive samples of data_in and computing their difference.

I'll start by declaring the module with the specified ports. Inside, I'll need a register to store the previous data value, prev_data.

The clock is asynchronous, so I'll use a positive-edge trigger for the main logic. When rst is high, both diff_out and valid should be 0, and prev_data should reset to 0.

After releasing the reset, on each rising edge of clk, the current data_in will be stored in prev_data after one clock cycle. Then, on the next rising edge, the difference between the new data_in and prev_data is computed for diff_out. The valid signal indicates that this difference is ready after one cycle from the last reset or new data.

I'll structure the code with always blocks: one for the reset and another for the clocked logic. I'll ensure that the outputs are properly assigned, especially handling the two-cycle delay for valid.

Now, putting it all together in Verilog syntax, making sure to follow the specifications exactly without any extra explanations.

```verilog
module digital_diff (
    input data_in,
    input clk,
    input rst,
    output diff_out,
    output valid
);

// Internal signals
reg prev_data;
reg valid_reg;

always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst) begin
        prev_data <= 0;
        valid_reg <= 0;
    end else begin
        // Capture previous data on rising edge of clock
        if (!valid_reg) begin
            prev_data <= data_in;
            valid_reg <= 1;
        end else begin
            // Compute difference after one cycle delay
            diff_out <= (data_in != prev_data);
            prev_data <= data_in;
        end
    end
end

assign valid = valid_reg;

endmodule
```
