Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. Let me think about how to approach this.

A 4-to-1 MUX takes four input signals and two selector bits (since 2^2 = 4). The output is one of the four inputs based on the combination of the selector bits.

The user specified the module name as `mux_4to1` with five ports: `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `sel`, and `y`. So I need to make sure the module declaration matches exactly.

I should use standard Verilog constructs. The most efficient way is to use a conditional statement based on the selector bits. Since there are two selector bits, I can use nested if-else statements or a case statement for clarity.

Using a case statement might be more readable and scalable if more selectors are added in the future. So I'll go with that approach.

I need to ensure all four cases are covered: sel being 00, 01, 10, and 11. Each case will assign the corresponding input (a, b, c, d) to the output y.

Now, considering the code structure, I'll define the module with the correct ports. The inputs a, b, c, d can be single bits, so they're declared as input wires. The selector `sel` is a 2-bit input wire, and `y` is the output wire.

I should also include comments to make the code clear, explaining each part briefly. That way, anyone reading the code can understand what's happening without confusion.

Wait, the user mentioned to provide only Verilog code in a ```verilog block and not add explanations. So I'll structure it accordingly, ensuring that the module name and ports match exactly as specified.

I think that's all. The code should be efficient, correct, and follow the user's guidelines precisely.

```verilog
module mux_4to1 (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire c,
    input wire d,
    input wire [1:0] sel,
    output wire y
);
    
    // Select one of four inputs based on 2-bit selector 'sel'
    case (sel)
        00: y = a;
        01: y = b;
        10: y = c;
        default: y = d;  // For sel == 11
    endcase
    
endmodule
```
