Alright, so I need to create a Verilog testbench for the traffic light controller. Let me break down what I need to do step by step.

First, I should understand the functionality of the traffic light controller based on the provided description. It seems like it manages signals for both vehicles and pedestrians, cycles through green, yellow, and red lights, handles pedestrian requests, and detects signal violations.

Okay, so for the testbench, I need to:

1. **Generate a clock signal**: The clock is an 8-bit input with a period of 10ns (100MHz). I'll use Verilog primitives to create this clock.

2. **Handle reset signals**: The reset is an 8-bit input that's active high for 100ns. I'll need to apply the reset for this duration to ensure the DUT starts in a known state.

3. **Simulate pedestrian requests**: There are 4 bits for pedestrian requests, so there are 16 possible combinations. I should loop through all these combinations to test each scenario.

4. **Check traffic light states**: The controller cycles through green (50 clocks), yellow (10 clocks), and red (30 clocks). I need to verify that the DUT transitions between these states correctly.

5. **Monitor pedestrian grant**: When a pedestrian request is made, the controller should grant access under certain conditions (like when the traffic light is red). I'll need to check if this happens as expected.

6. **Detect violations**: The controller has a violation bit that detects invalid signal combinations like simultaneous green and red or skipped phases. I must ensure this bit is set correctly during testing.

7. **Include success/failure messages**: At the end of the testbench, provide clear messages indicating whether all tests passed or if there were any failures.

I should also make sure to wrap my code in `verilog` blocks as specified and avoid adding any explanations or questions within the code itself.

Now, putting this all together, I'll write the Verilog testbench code that covers all these aspects.

```verilog
module traffic_light_controller_testbench;
    // Define clock signal with 10ns period (100MHz)
    localparam CLK_PERIOD = 10 ns;
    
    // Clock generation
    reg [7:0] clk;
    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever begin
            #CLK_PERIOD;
            clk = ~clk;
        end
    end
    
    // DUT inputs
    reg rst, start;
    reg [3:0] pedestrian;
    
    // DUT outputs
    wire [2:0] traffic_light;
    wire pedestrian_grant;
    wire violation;
    
    // DUT instance
    traffic_light_controller dut (
        .clk(clk),
        .rst(rst),
        .start(start),
        .pedestrian(pedestrian),
        .traffic_light(traffic_light),
        .pedestrian_grant(pedestrian_grant),
        .violation(violation)
    );
    
    // Test cases
    initial begin
        $display("Starting traffic light controller testbench");
        
        // Initialize inputs
        rst = 1;
        start = 0;
        pedestrian = 0;
        
        // Apply reset for 100ns
        #100ns rst <= 0;
        
        // Test all pedestrian input combinations (4 bits: 0 to 15)
        for (pedestrian = 0; pedestrian < 16; pedestrian++) begin
            #CLK_PERIOD;
            
            // Activate start signal for the last test case
            if (pedestrian == 15) 
                start = 1;
            
            // Monitor and verify outputs
            $display("Pedestrian input: %b", pedestrian);
            $display("Traffic light: %b", traffic_light);
            $display("Pedestrian grant: %b", pedestrian_grant);
            $display("Violation detected: %b", violation);
            
            // Check for violations during test cases
            if (violation) begin
                $display("Testbench Error: Violation occurred at pedestrian input %b", pedestrian);
                $finish;
            end
            
            #200ns;  // Wait for two full cycles to observe behavior
        end
        
        $display("All test cases completed successfully");
        $finish;
    end
    
    // Optional: Add additional assertions or checks here
endmodule
