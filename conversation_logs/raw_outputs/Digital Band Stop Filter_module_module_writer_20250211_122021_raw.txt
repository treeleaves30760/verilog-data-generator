Okay, I need to create a Verilog module for a digital band stop filter based on the given specifications. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the module is called `band_stop_filter` and it has specific input and output ports: clk, rst_n, data_in, coefficients, enable, data_out, valid, and overflow. I need to make sure all these are included correctly.

The filter can be either IIR or FIR. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume an FIR implementation because it's more straightforward for a band stop filter using coefficients provided.

Looking at the functionality, the module needs coefficient memory. So I'll use a register `coeff_reg` to store the incoming coefficients. The data_in will be processed over several clock cycles, so I need a shift register or some kind of delay line to handle the FIR filtering.

The arithmetic units will involve multiplication and addition. For each tap in the filter, I'll multiply the delayed data by the corresponding coefficient and sum them up. Since it's a 16-bit signal, I have to manage potential overflows. The overflow output should be set if any of these operations cause an overflow.

I also need to handle the validity of the output. The valid output should only be asserted when the filter has completed processing and there was no overflow during the computation.

For the clock domain crossing, since the module operates at a different clock domain than the rest of the system, I'll use asynchronous FIFOs with handshake signals to safely transfer data between domains without timing issues.

Now, putting it all together:

- Use a shift register to store delayed data_in.
- Multiply each delayed data by the corresponding coefficient and sum them.
- Detect overflow during summation.
- After processing, if no overflow, set valid high and output the result.

I think I've covered all the points. Now, writing the code with these considerations in mind.

module band_stop_filter (
    input clk,
    input rst_n,
    input [15:0] data_in,
    input [15:0] coefficients,
    input enable,
    output reg [15:0] data_out,
    output reg valid,
    output overflow
);

    // Internal signals and registers
    reg rst;
    reg [15:0] coeff_reg, data_reg;
    wire [15:0] multiply_result;
    reg [31:0] accumulator;
    reg overflow_flag;

        if (~rst_n) begin
            rst <= 1;
        end else begin
            rst <= 0;
        end
    end

    // Main processing logic
    always @(posedge clk) begin
        if (rst) begin

            overflow_flag <= 0;
            valid <= 0;
        end else if (enable) begin
            // Update coefficient and data registers
            coeff_reg <= coefficients;
            data_reg <= data_in;

            // FIR filter processing
            multiply_result = signed_mult(data_reg, coeff_reg);
            accumulator = add_with_overflow(accumulator, multiply_result);
            overflow_flag = $overflow(accumulator);

            // Validity and output handling
            if (overflow_flag) begin
                valid <= 0;
            end else begin
                valid <= 1;
            end

            data_out <= accumulator[15:0];
        end
    end

    // Helper functions for arithmetic operations
    function signed_mult(a, b);
        input [15:0] a, b;
        output [31:0] signed_mult;
        integer i;
        for (i = 0; i < 32; i = i + 1) begin
            if (i < 16) begin
                signed_mult[i] = a[i] & b[i];
            end else begin
                signed_mult[i] = a[15] & b[15];
            end
        end
    endfunction

    function add_with_overflow(a, b);
        input [31:0] a, b;
        output [31:0] add_with_overflow;
        add_with_overflow = a + b;
    endfunction
