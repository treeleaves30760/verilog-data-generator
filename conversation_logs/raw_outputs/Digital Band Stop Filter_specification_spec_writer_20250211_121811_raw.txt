Topic: Digital Band Stop Filter
Phase: specification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Band Stop Filter based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user provided an example of how they want the specification structured. It includes Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. They emphasized using only the specification without any extra text or markdown, so I need to stick strictly to that format.

The user mentioned it's a Digital Band Stop Filter. I should recall what such a filter does. A band stop filter is designed to suppress frequencies within a specific range (the stop band) while allowing signals outside this range to pass through. In digital terms, this would typically be implemented using an IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) or FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter.

Looking at the example provided, it's structured with clear sections. The module name is straightforward. The description should briefly explain the purpose of the filter. Inputs and outputs are listed with their widths and descriptions. Functionality needs a concise explanation of how the filter operates, including key components like the coefficient memory and arithmetic units. Timing requirements specify the clock, reset, and any necessary timing details.

I need to ensure that all necessary details are included for implementation. That means specifying the data types (like 16-bit or 32-bit integers), control signals (enable, reset), and clock information. Also, the functionality should outline the main operations without getting too deep into the algorithm specifics, as that's more for the design phase.

I should also consider the user's possible deeper needs. They might be integrating this filter into a larger system, so clear I/O definitions are crucial. They probably need enough detail to start implementing the Verilog code but not overly detailed explanations.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure each section as per the example, ensuring clarity and completeness. The module name will reflect its purpose. Inputs include clock, reset, data_in, coefficients, and control signals. Outputs will be data_out and status flags like valid and overflow.

In the functionality section, I'll mention the use of IIR/FIR algorithms, coefficient memory, arithmetic units for processing, and the control logic for enabling and resetting. Timing details will cover the clock frequency, reset polarity, and synchronization.

I need to avoid any markdown or code blocks as per their instructions, so just plain text with clear sections. Also, ensure that each part is concise but informative enough for someone to understand and implement the filter correctly.

Finally, I'll review everything to make sure it aligns with the example they provided and covers all necessary aspects without unnecessary fluff.

1. Module Name: digital_band_stop_filter  
2. Description: A digital band stop filter designed to suppress frequencies within a specified stop band while allowing signals outside this range to pass through.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - rst_n: 1 bit Active-low reset signal  
   - data_in: 16 bits Input digital signal to be filtered  
   - coefficients: 16 bits Filter coefficients for stop band suppression  
   - enable: 1 bit Enable control signal  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: 16 bits Output digital signal after filtering  
   - valid: 1 bit Indicates if the output is valid  
   - overflow: 1 bit Detects overflow conditions during processing  
5. Functionality:  
   The filter operates based on IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) or FIR (Finite Impulse Response) algorithm, depending on the implementation. It includes:  
   - Coefficient memory to store filter coefficients for stop band suppression.  
   - Arithmetic units for signal processing and coefficient multiplication.  
   - Control logic to manage enable/disable functionality and reset operations.  
   - Validity checking to ensure output integrity.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz System clock  
   - Reset (rst_n): Active-low asynchronous reset with hold time of 2 clock cycles  
   - Filter processing latency: 32 clock cycles for coefficient application
