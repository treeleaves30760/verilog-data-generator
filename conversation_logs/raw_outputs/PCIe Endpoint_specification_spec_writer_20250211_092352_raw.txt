Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a PCIe Endpoint. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that PCIe is a high-speed interface used in computers and other devices, right? So an endpoint would be like the device connected to the PCIe bus.

First, the module name should probably be something like pcie_endpoint. That makes sense. Now, the description: it's a digital circuit implementing PCIe protocol as an endpoint. Got it.

Next are the inputs. I think PCIe uses some standard signals. There's the clock and reset. The clock would be a high-frequency signal, maybe 250MHz or something like that. Reset is usually active low, so rst_n. Then there are the configuration space interface signals: cfg_addr, which is an address bus, probably 6 bits wide since PCIe config addresses are up to 64 bits but maybe we're using a subset here. cfg_data would be the data bus, maybe 32 bits? And cfg_write would indicate if it's a write operation.

Then there are the command and status signals: cmd and sts, each probably 16 bits. The interrupt signal int is likely a single bit since it's just an interrupt request. Also, some GPIOs for general purposes, maybe gpios_in and gpios_out with widths of 8 bits each.

Now the outputs. There are transaction layer signals like tl_bar_rdy to indicate readiness, tl_bar_adr for the address, tl_bar_wr for write operations, tl_bar_wdata for write data, tl_bar_wstrb for byte enables, tl_bar_rdata for read data, and tl_bar_rresp for response. Each of these has specific widths: adr is 6 bits, wr is 1 bit, wdata is 32 bits, wstrb is 4 bits, rdata is 32 bits, and rresp is 2 bits.

The functionality part needs to describe how the module works. It should handle configuration space reads and writes based on the ccfg_addr and ccfg_write signals. When there's a write, it updates the internal state accordingly. For reads, it sends data back through ccfg_data. The command and status registers are accessed via specific offsets in the config address.

The interrupt functionality is also important. It should support multiple vectors, maybe up to 4, each with its own enable bit. When an interrupt condition occurs and its corresponding enable bit is set, it asserts the int signal.

For the transaction layer, the module acts as a PCIe endpoint, handling bus mastering and I/O transactions. It needs to be compatible with PCIe protocol specifications for proper communication over the PCIe bus.

Timing requirements include a clock at 250MHz, reset as active low, and setup/hold times for data stability. The reset should hold for at least one clock cycle before other signals are considered valid.

I think I covered all the necessary parts. Let me make sure I didn't miss any inputs or outputs. Configuration space, command/status, interrupt, and transaction layer signals seem to be included. Functionality-wise, handling config reads/writes, interrupts, and PCIe transactions makes sense. Timing is also addressed with clock and reset details.

I should double-check the widths of each signal. For example, ccfg_addr is 6 bits because PCIe configuration addresses are typically 6 bits for endpoint devices. Cfg_data being 32 bits seems right since data transfers in PCIe can be up to 32 or 64 bits depending on the implementation.

Also, ensuring that all necessary signals are included for proper communication with the PCIe bus controller. The transaction layer outputs like tl_bar_rdy, adr, wr, etc., are crucial for handling read and write operations correctly.

Overall, I think this covers the main aspects needed for a Verilog specification of a PCIe Endpoint module.
