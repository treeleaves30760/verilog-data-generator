Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Generator based on the user's query. Let me break down what they're asking for.

First, the user wants a structured specification following specific sections: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. They also mentioned not using markdown or code blocks, but in their example, they used a code block with triple backticks. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that, but since they provided an example within a code block, perhaps they expect the response to be formatted similarly.

Looking at the example they gave, it's clear and concise. Each section is labeled clearly. So, I should follow that structure precisely. 

The Digital Signal Generator needs to generate various digital signals like sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waves. It should have a programmable frequency and phase shift. That means I'll need input ports for selecting the waveform type, setting the frequency, and adjusting the phase.

For the Inputs section, I'll include Clk (clock signal), Rst (reset), Wavetype which is 2 bits to cover four types, Freqsel for frequency selection with a few options, Phaseshift as a 4-bit input for phase control, and Amplitude as another 4-bit input for the output's range.

The Outputs will be Sout, a wide signal (16 bits) representing the generated waveform, and Led indicating when the generator is active.

In the Functionality section, I need to describe how the module works. It should cycle through the selected waveform based on the clock, reset upon reset, update frequency and phase when inputs change, handle amplitude by scaling the output, and use a lookup table for sine waves since it's more complex than the others.

For Timing Requirements, the clock is crucialâ€”positive edge-sensitive. The reset should hold all outputs low until released. Frequency changes should take effect on the next rising edge after setup, and phase shifts should update immediately but only when not in reset.

I need to make sure each part is clear and detailed enough for implementation without being overly verbose. Also, since the user emphasized no additional text or explanations beyond the specification, I'll stick strictly to the format they provided.

```verilog
1. Module Name: DigitalSignalGenerator  
2. Description: A digital signal generator capable of producing sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms with programmable frequency and phase shift.  
3. Inputs:  
   - Clk: 1 bit Clock signal  
   - Rst: 1 bit Reset signal  
   - Wavetype: 2 bits Waveform type selection (00: Sine, 01: Square, 10: Triangle, 11: Sawtooth)  
   - Freqsel: 3 bits Frequency selection (supports 4 different frequencies)  
   - Phaseshift: 4 bits Phase shift control (0 to 15 degrees in 1-degree increments)  
   - Amplitude: 4 bits Output amplitude control (0 to 15 LSB steps)  
4. Outputs:  
   - Sout: 16 bits Generated digital waveform output  
   - Led: 1 bit Indicator for generator activity status  
5. Functionality:  
   - Generates the selected waveform type based on Wavetype input.  
   - Modulates frequency based on Freqsel input, with predefined clock cycles per period.  
   - Adjusts phase shift according to Phaseshift input during waveform generation.  
   - Scales output amplitude according to Amplitude input, with 16-bit resolution.  
   - Implements a lookup table for sine wave generation and mathematical calculations for other waveforms.  
   - Outputs the generated signal on Sout and provides activity indication on Led.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (Clk): Positive edge-sensitive clock at 50 MHz  
   - Reset (Rst): Active-high reset, holds all outputs low until released  
   - Frequency changes take effect on the next rising edge after setup is complete  
   - Phase shift updates occur immediately upon input change, unless in reset state
