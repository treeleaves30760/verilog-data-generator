Alright, I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Comparator based on the user's query. Let me start by understanding what a digital comparator does. It compares two binary numbers and determines if one is greater than, less than, or equal to the other.

The user wants the specification in a specific format with sections like Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements. I should make sure each section is clear and concise.

For the module name, "DigitalComparator" seems appropriate. The description should briefly explain its purposeâ€”comparing two binary numbers and outputting the result.

Next, the inputs. Both A and B are 4-bit binary numbers, so I'll list them as such with their respective bit widths. Each input has a description explaining what they represent.

Outputs include Equal (E), Greater than (G), and Less than (L). These are single bits indicating the comparison result. I should describe each output clearly.

In the functionality section, I need to outline how the comparator works. It compares A and B bit by bit from the most significant bit, determining if one is greater or if they're equal. If all bits are equal, it outputs E as 1; otherwise, it sets G or L based on which number is larger.

For timing requirements, I'll note that the design uses a clock (clk) and an active-high reset (rst). The critical path delay should be under 10 nanoseconds for a 100 MHz clock, ensuring timely operations. Synchronous reset with positive edge detection will be used for proper initialization.

I should ensure all details are included without unnecessary explanations, sticking to the specified format. No markdown or code blocks, just plain text within the given structure.

```  
Module Name: DigitalComparator  
Description: A 4-bit digital comparator that compares two binary numbers and outputs their relationship (equal, greater than, less than).  

Inputs:  
- A: 4-bit binary number to be compared.  
- B: 4-bit binary number to be compared.  

Outputs:  
- E: 1-bit output indicating equality (A == B).  
- G: 1-bit output indicating greater than (A > B).  
- L: 1-bit output indicating less than (A < B).  

Functionality:  
The comparator performs a bitwise comparison of A and B. It starts from the most significant bit (MSB) and proceeds to the least significant bit (LSB). If all bits are equal, E is set to 1. Otherwise, G is set if A > B, and L is set if A < B.  

Timing Requirements:  
- Clock: clk (positive edge-sensitive clock).  
- Reset: rst (active-high synchronous reset).  
- Critical path delay: <= 10 ns for a 100 MHz clock.
