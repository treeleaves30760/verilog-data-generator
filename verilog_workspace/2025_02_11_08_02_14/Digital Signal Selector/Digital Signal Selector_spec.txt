2. Description: A 4-to-1 digital signal selector that routes one of four input signals to the output based on a 2-bit control input.  
3. Inputs:  
   - D0: 1 bit Description: First data input  
   - D1: 1 bit Description: Second data input  
   - D2: 1 bit Description: Third data input  
   - D3: 1 bit Description: Fourth data input  
   - S[1]: 1 bit Description: Select control bit (MSB)  
   - S[0]: 1 bit Description: Select control bit (LSB)  
4. Outputs:  
   - Y: 1 bit Description: Selected output signal  
5. Functionality:  
   The module selects one of the four input signals (D0, D1, D2, or D3) based on the binary value of the select control S[1:0]. When S is "00", D0 is selected; when S is "01", D1 is selected; when S is "10", D2 is selected; and when S is "11", D3 is selected. The output Y reflects the value of the selected input.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: Clk 50 MHz Description: System clock signal  
   - Reset: Rst_n Active High Description: Asynchronous reset signal  
   - Setup Time: 1 ns Description: Minimum setup time for inputs relative to the clock  
   - Hold Time: 2 ns Description: Minimum hold time for inputs relative to the clock
