Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Demodulator based on the user's example. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I'll start by understanding what a Digital Signal Demodulator does. It takes a digital modulated signal and recovers the original data. The example provided includes inputs like clock, reset, modulated_data_in, and outputs like demodulated_data_out, error_flag, and lock. 

I should structure my specification similarly: Module Name, Description, Inputs, Outputs, Functionality, and Timing Requirements.

For the Module Name, I'll name it `digital_signal_demodulator` to clearly indicate its purpose.

In the Description, I need a brief overview. The example says it's for recovering data from a modulated signal, so I can mirror that but perhaps add more specifics if needed.

Next are the Inputs. The example lists clock, reset, and modulated_data_in with their widths and descriptions. I should include these as well. Maybe think about any other necessary inputs? Perhaps a data_valid signal to indicate when the input is valid, or maybe some control signals, but the example doesn't have those, so perhaps it's better to stick close.

Outputs: The example includes demodulated_data_out, error_flag, and lock. I'll include these as well with their respective widths and descriptions.

Functionality-wise, the example explains that it processes the input signal using a clock, applies filtering, detects errors, and indicates when the signal is locked. I can follow this structure but perhaps elaborate a bit more if necessary.

Timing Requirements: The example mentions a system clock of 100 MHz, reset polarity, and lock assertion after valid frames. I should include similar details, maybe specifying the clock frequency and reset type.

I need to ensure that each section is clear and concise, mirroring the example's structure without adding unnecessary complexity. Also, make sure all necessary signals are included for a functional demodulator.

Wait, in the example, modulated_data_in is 1 bit wide, which makes sense for digital signals. The outputs are also single bits except for demodulated_data_out, which might vary based on data width. But since it's not specified, I'll keep it as 1 bit unless told otherwise.

I think that covers all parts. Now, putting it all together in the specified format without any markdown or code blocks.

Module Name: digital_signal_demodulator  
Description: Digital Signal Demodulator for recovering data from a modulated signal.  
Inputs:  
- clock: 1 System Clock (50 MHz)  
- reset_n: 1 Active-low Reset signal  
- modulated_data_in: 1 Modulated input data stream  

Outputs:  
- demodulated_data_out: 1 Demodulated output data stream  
- error_flag: 1 Indicates detection of errors during demodulation  
- lock: 1 Indicates that the demodulator has locked onto the signal  

Functionality:  
The Digital Signal Demodulator processes the modulated input data to recover the original digital signal. It operates as follows:  
1. Synchronizes with the input signal using a clock and reset_n.  
2. Applies filtering techniques to remove noise and extract the baseband signal.  
3. Implements demodulation algorithms (e.g., QAM, PSK) to convert the modulated signal into digital data.  
4. Monitors for errors during the demodulation process and sets error_flag if detected.  
5. Asserts lock when synchronization is achieved and maintained.  

Timing Requirements:  
- System Clock: 100 MHz  
- Reset_n: Active-low reset with a hold time of at least one clock cycle.  
- Lock assertion occurs after detecting valid synchronization frames, typically within 10 clock cycles.
