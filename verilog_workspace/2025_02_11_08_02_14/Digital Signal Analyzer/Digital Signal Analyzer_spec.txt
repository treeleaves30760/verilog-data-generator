2. Description: A digital signal analyzer module designed to process and analyze digital signals in real-time. It captures input data, detects triggers, performs analysis tasks such as frequency measurement, and generates output results.  
3. Inputs:  
   - clk: 1 bit (System clock)  
   - rst: 1 bit (Active-high reset signal)  
   - data_in: N bits (Digital signal input to be analyzed)  
   - valid_in: 1 bit (Indicates if data_in is valid for the current clock cycle)  
   - trigger_source: M bits (External trigger signal or source for triggering analysis operations)  
4. Outputs:  
   - data_out: N bits (Processed and analyzed output data)  
   - analyze_done: 1 bit (Indicates completion of analysis operation)  
   - trigger_flag: 1 bit (Flag indicating a trigger event has been detected)  
   - error_flag: 1 bit (Indicates if an error condition has occurred during analysis)  
   - config_ready: 1 bit (Indicates that the analyzer is ready for configuration updates)  
5. Functionality:  
   - Captures digital signals from data_in and stores them in internal memory for processing.  
   - Detects trigger events based on trigger_source and valid_in signals.  
   - Performs analysis operations such as frequency measurement, peak detection, and filtering.  
   - Generates output results in data_out and sets corresponding flags (analyze_done, trigger_flag, error_flag).  
   - Supports configuration updates via config_ready signal.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock: 50 MHz to 100 MHz  
   - Reset: Active-high reset with a hold time of at least 3 clock cycles.  
   - Trigger detection: Must be detected within 2 clock cycles after trigger_source assertion.  
   - Analysis operations must complete within a specified timeframe, typically determined by the input data rate and analysis complexity.
