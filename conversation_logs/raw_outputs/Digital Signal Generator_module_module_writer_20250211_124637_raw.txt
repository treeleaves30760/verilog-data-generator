Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer based on the user's request. Let me start by understanding what a 4-to-1 MUX does. It takes four inputs and two selector bits, and outputs one of the inputs based on the combination of the selectors.

The user provided an example where they wrote a simple MUX with four data inputs (in0 to in3), two select inputs (s0 and s1), and an output (out). The module is named mux_4to1. I should follow that structure.

First, I'll define the module with the correct ports. The inputs are in0, in1, in2, in3, s0, and s1, and the output is out. All these should be of type wire.

Next, I need to implement the logic. The selectors s0 and s1 determine which input is passed to the output. Since there are two selector bits, they can represent four different combinations (00, 01, 10, 11). Each combination corresponds to one of the four inputs.

In Verilog, I can use a case statement inside an always block to handle each selector combination. The case statement will check the value of s1 and s0 together and assign the corresponding input to the output.

I should also include comments to make the code clear. Maybe a comment above explaining what the module does and another for each case in the case statement.

Wait, do I need to declare any internal wires? No, because all operations are direct assignments. So no additional wires are needed beyond the ports.

Let me double-check the syntax. The module starts with `module mux_4to1 (` and ends with `endmodule`. Inside, the always block is used for combinational logic. Oh wait, in the example, they used an always @(*) block. I should do the same to ensure all inputs are considered.

So inside the always block, I'll use a case statement that checks each combination of s1 and s0 and assigns the corresponding input to out.

I think that's it. The code should be efficient and correct, following the user's guidelines precisely.

```verilog
module mux_4to1 (
    input wire [1:0] s,
    input wire in0,
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    input wire in3,
    output wire out
);

    always @(*) begin
        case (s)
            2'b00:  // Select input0 when s is 00
                out = in0;
            2'b01:  // Select input1 when s is 01
                out = in1;
            2'b10:  // Select input2 when s is 10
                out = in2;
            2'b11:  // Select input3 when s is 11
                out = in3;
        endcase
    end

endmodule
