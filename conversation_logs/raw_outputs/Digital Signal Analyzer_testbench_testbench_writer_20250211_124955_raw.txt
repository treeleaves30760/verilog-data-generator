Alright, I need to create a testbench for the Digital Signal Analyzer module based on the user's requirements. The user has specified several points that must be addressed in the testbench:

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Ensure all input combinations are tested.
2. **Clock Generation**: Include a clock signal with a frequency between 50 MHz and 100 MHz.
3. **Reset Handling**: Properly handle reset signals, holding them for at least three clock cycles.
4. **Success/Failure Messages**: Provide clear messages indicating whether each test case passed or failed.

First, I'll outline the structure of the testbench:

- **Initialization**: Set all inputs to their default values and apply the reset signal.
- **Clock Generation**: Create a continuous clock signal with the specified frequency.
- **Test Cases**: Implement multiple test scenarios to cover different functionalities:
  - Test after reset.
  - Valid data without trigger.
  - Trigger detection.
  - Error condition testing.
  - Config ready signal verification.

I'll start by initializing all inputs to their default states. For example, setting `rst` to 1 ensures the module starts in a known state. Other inputs like `data_in`, `valid_in`, and `trigger_source` are set to 0.

Next, I'll generate the clock signal. Given the frequency range, I'll choose 100 MHz for simplicity, which results in a period of 10 nanoseconds. The clock will toggle every 5 nanoseconds within an infinite loop.

After setting up the clock, I'll apply the reset signal. According to the user's instruction, the reset should be held for at least three clock cycles, so I'll wait for 60 nanoseconds before releasing it.

Now, I'll proceed with each test case:

1. **All Inputs Low After Reset**: This tests the module's behavior immediately after coming out of reset. I'll check if `trigger_flag` and `error_flag` are both low.

2. **Valid Data Without Trigger**: Here, I'll send a valid data packet by setting `valid_in` to 1 while keeping `trigger_source` at 0. This tests the module's response to valid data without any trigger event.

3. **Trigger Detection**: In this case, I'll send another valid data packet but set `trigger_source` to a non-zero value (e.g., 3). This tests whether the module correctly detects and responds to a trigger event.

4. **Error Condition Test**: To test error detection, I'll send invalid data (represented here as all 'Z's) by setting `data_in` to 8'hZZ. This checks if the module correctly identifies and flags invalid input.

5. **Config Ready Signal Test**: Finally, I'll reset the module again and check if the `config_ready` signal is asserted after the reset. This ensures that the module signals readiness for configuration properly.

Throughout this process, I'll include delays to ensure each test case waits for the necessary clock cycles before checking the outputs. If any of these checks fail, an error message will be displayed; otherwise, a success message will confirm that all tests passed.

By methodically testing each scenario, I can ensure that the Digital Signal Analyzer module functions correctly under various conditions.

```verilog
module testbench_analyzer;
    // Define clock frequency (50 MHz to 100 MHz)
    parameter CLOCK_FREQ = 100 MHz;  // Example: 100 MHz
    
    // Generate clock signal
    generate_clock(CLK, CLOCK_FREQ);
    
    // Reset signal handling
    reg rst;
    initial begin
        rst = 1;
        #50ns;
        rst = 0;
    end

    // Test cases
    test_case tc();
    
endmodule
```
