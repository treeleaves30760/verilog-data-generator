Alright, I need to create a Verilog module called digital_signal_decoder based on the given specifications. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the module has three inputs: clk, rst_n, and encoded_data_in. The outputs are decoded_data_out and decode_error. The encoded_data_in is 8 bits wide, as seen in the testbench where it's defined as logic [7:0]. Similarly, the decoded_data_out is also 8 bits.

The functionality involves decoding the input data. Since the testbench expects the decoded output to be the same as the encoded input, I think the simplest implementation for now is to pass the encoded_data_in directly to decoded_data_out. This way, each test case can verify if the decoder works correctly by comparing the input and output.

Next, I need to handle the reset signal rst_n, which is active low. So when rst_n is 0, the module should reset all its states. I'll use a synchronous reset on the rising edge of clk because that's standard practice for Verilog designs.

For the clock, it's specified as a 100 MHz system clock. The testbench already generates this with a period of 10 ns (5ns high and 5ns low). So in my module, I don't need to generate the clock; I just need to use the provided clk signal.

The decoding algorithm isn't specified, so for simplicity, I'll implement a basic pass-through where decoded_data_out equals encoded_data_in. This allows the testbench to check each possible input and see if the output matches without any errors.

Error detection is optional, but since it's recommended, I can add some basic checks. For example, if the encoded data has certain invalid patterns, decode_error could be set. But since the testbench doesn't expect any errors in this setup, maybe I'll leave it for a future version or implement something trivial like checking for all zeros.

I should include comments to explain each part of the code clearly. The module will have a always @(posedge clk) block for synchronous operations. Inside this block, I'll handle the reset condition and then perform the decoding logic.

Putting it all together, the module will synchronize on the rising edge of clk, reset when rst_n is low, and pass the encoded data to decoded_data_out. The decode_error can be set based on some condition, but for now, I'll initialize it and maybe set it if certain invalid conditions occur.

I think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll write the Verilog code accordingly.

```verilog
module digital_signal_decoder #(
    // Parameter definitions (if any specific encoding/decoding schemes are chosen)
    // These can be added as needed based on the decoding algorithm
) (
    input  logic clk,          // System clock
    input  logic rst_n,       // Active-low reset
    input  logic [7:0] encoded_data_in, // Encoded digital data input (8 bits)
    output logic [7:0] decoded_data_out, // Decoded digital data output (8 bits)
    output logic decode_error           // Decode error flag
);

// Synchronization and basic state handling
always @(posedge clk) begin
    if (~rst_n) begin
        // Reset conditions
        decoded_data_out <= 8'h00; // Output reset to 0x00
        decode_error     <= 1'b0;   // Clear any error flags on reset
    end else begin
        // Decoding logic implementation
        // For this example, we'll implement a simple pass-through with basic checks
        decoded_data_out <= encoded_data_in; // Direct pass-through for demonstration
        
        // Error detection (optional)
        // Add specific decoding algorithm and error checking here
        // Example: Check for invalid encoding patterns
        if (~encoded_data_in[7] | ~encoded_data_in[0]) begin
            decode_error <= 1'b1;
        end else begin
            decode_error <= 1'b0; // Clear error unless condition is met
        end
    end
end

// Optional: Add any additional logic or state machines based on decoding requirements

endmodule
