Okay, so I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that a 4-to-1 MUX takes four input lines and two control lines (since 2^2 = 4) to select which data is passed through. The output will be one of the four inputs based on the combination of the control signals.

Looking at the example provided by the user for a 2-to-1 MUX, they used an if-else structure with a single control line. For a 4-to-1 MUX, I'll need two control lines to cover all four possible selections.

I should define the module with inputs data_in0, data_in1, data_in2, data_in3, sel0, and sel1, and an output y. The control signals sel0 and sel1 will determine which input is selected. 

In Verilog, I can use a case statement to handle all possible combinations of sel1 and sel0. Each case will assign the corresponding data_in to the output y.

I need to ensure that all possible cases are covered, including the default case where none of the conditions match, though in this scenario, with two control lines, all combinations should be handled explicitly.

Including comments is important for clarity, so I'll add a comment explaining that the module selects between four inputs based on the sel1 and sel0 control signals.

Now, putting it all together, I'll write a module using a case statement to assign y based on the values of sel1 and sel0.

```verilog
module mux4to1 (
    input wire data_in0,
    input wire data_in1,
    input wire data_in2,
    input wire data_in3,
    input wire sel0,
    input wire sel1,
    output wire y
);

    // This module selects between four input lines based on the two control signals sel1 and sel0
    case ({sel1, sel0}) // Combining both control signals into a 2-bit selector
        0:   y = data_in0;     // When sel is 00, output data_in0
        1:   y = data_in1;     // When sel is 01, output data_in1
        2:   y = data_in2;     // When sel is 10, output data_in2
        default: y = data_in3;  // All other cases (sel is 11), output data_in3
    endcase

endmodule
```
