I should double-check that each section is correctly labeled and that the information is accurate. For example, ensuring the input widths match what's needed for a 16-bit signal and that the functionality aligns with typical demodulator operations like processing amplitude, frequency, or phase shifts.

Also, considering the user might be an engineer looking to implement this in hardware, I should make sure the spec is detailed enough for someone to understand and build upon without ambiguity.

I think that's all. Now, I'll structure the response accordingly.
