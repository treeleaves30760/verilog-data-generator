Okay, so I need to create an 8x8 multiplier in Verilog. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that multiplying two 8-bit numbers will give a result up to 16 bits because 255 * 255 = 65025, which is within 16 bits. So my output should be 16 bits wide.

I remember that in Verilog, I can use loops to generate the multiplication logic instead of writing each line manually. That would save time and make the code cleaner.

So, I'll start by initializing a sum variable to zero. Then, for each bit in the multiplier (b), I'll calculate the partial product by multiplying the multiplicand (a) with that specific bit of b. After that, I'll shift this partial product left by the position of the bit and add it to the sum.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initialize sum to 0.
2. Loop through each bit of b from 0 to 7.
3. For each bit:
   a. Extract the ith bit of b using (b >> i) & 1.
   b. Multiply this bit by a to get the partial product.
   c. Shift the partial product left by i positions.
   d. Add this shifted value to sum.
4. After all bits are processed, assign sum to the output product.

I think this approach should work correctly. It efficiently uses a loop to handle each bit of b and accumulates the result in sum, which is then assigned to the output.

Now, let me write the Verilog code based on these steps.

```verilog
module multiplier_8x8 (
    input  [7:0] a,
    input  [7:0] b,
    output [15:0] product
);

always @* begin
    [15:0] sum;
    integer i;
    
    sum = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) begin
        [15:0] partial_product;
        partial_product = a * ((b >> i) & 1);
        partial_product = partial_product << i;
        sum = sum + partial_product;
    end
    product = sum;
end

endmodule
```
