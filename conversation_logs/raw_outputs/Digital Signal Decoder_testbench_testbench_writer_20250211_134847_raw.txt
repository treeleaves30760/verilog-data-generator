Alright, I need to create a Verilog testbench for the digital_signal_decoder module. The goal is to thoroughly test all possible input combinations and ensure the outputs behave as expected. Let's break down what needs to be done step by step.

First, I'll start by setting up the basic structure of the testbench. This includes defining the necessary signals such as the clock (clk), reset (rst_n), encoded_data_in, decoded_data_out, and decode_error. These signals will be used to interface with the digital_signal_decoder module under test.

Next, I need to generate a clock signal at 100 MHz. In Verilog, this can be achieved using an always block that toggles the clock signal every 5 nanoseconds (ns), which corresponds to a period of 10 ns for a 100 MHz clock.

The reset signal, rst_n, is active low, meaning it will be initialized to 0 and then released after a short delay to ensure proper reset timing. This should be handled in the initial block where I also initialize other signals to their default states.

For the encoded_data_in, since its width isn't specified, I'll assume an 8-bit input for testing purposes. This means I'll create a variable to hold this input signal and iterate through all possible values from 0 to 255 (since 2^8 = 256).

I need to test each combination by assigning the current value to encoded_data_in and then checking if the decoded output matches what's expected. Since the decoding algorithm isn't specified, I'll assume a simple case where decoded_data_out equals the encoded_data_in.

To monitor the tests, I'll use $monitor to display each test case and whether it passed or failed. After all tests are run, I'll print a success message if no failures occurred; otherwise, I'll note how many tests failed.

Additionally, I need to check the decode_error output. If it's high during any test, that indicates an error, which I can capture using $error to log the failure.

I should ensure that all signals are properly initialized and that there's a reset pulse applied before starting the tests. This ensures the module starts in a known state.

Finally, after running all tests, I'll print a completion message to indicate the testbench has finished.

                             i, decoded_data_out, decode_error));

        $display("All test cases completed successfully");
