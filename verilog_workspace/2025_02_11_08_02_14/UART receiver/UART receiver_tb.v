First, I'll start by understanding what the DUT (Device Under Test) is. From the previous example, it looks like we're dealing with an XOR gate that takes two inputs (`in1` and `in2`) and produces one output.

I need to create a testbench module that will:

1. Generate a clock signal.
2. Apply all possible input combinations to the DUT.
3. Check if the outputs match the expected results.
4. Display success or failure messages for each test case.

I'll start by defining the inputs and outputs of the DUT in the testbench. Then, I'll create the clock generation logic using a forever loop. Next, I'll implement the reset signal to ensure the DUT starts in a known state.

For testing all input combinations, I'll use a loop that iterates through all possible values of `in1` and `in2`. For each combination, I'll wait for one clock period to allow the DUT to process the inputs, then check if the output matches the expected result. If it does, I'll display a success message; otherwise, I'll display a failure message.

Finally, after all test cases are executed, I'll display a completion message indicating whether all tests passed or if there were any failures.
