Topic: Digital High Pass Filter
Phase: specification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<think>
Okay, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital High Pass Filter. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand what a high pass filter does. It's a circuit that allows signals above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies. In the digital domain, this is typically implemented using a difference equation and then converted into an FIR or IIR filter structure. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume an FIR approach because it's straightforward for Verilog implementation.

Next, I need to outline the module name. It should be something descriptive like `digital_high_pass_filter`.

Now, the description: A digital high pass filter that processes input samples and outputs filtered samples above a specified cutoff frequency.

For inputs, I'll need a clock (clk) and a reset (rst). Both are typically 1-bit signals. Then, there's the input data (d_in), which is a signed integer or logic bit depending on the design. Since it's digital, using a fixed-point representation makes sense; maybe 16 bits for the input.

The output will be similar to the input but after filtering. So, d_out would also be a 16-bit signed integer.

Functionality-wise, I need to describe that the filter processes each sample based on its difference equation. The example given uses y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1], which is a simple first-order high pass filter. This means it subtracts the previous input from the current input to get the output.

Timing requirements are important for Verilog. I'll need to specify that the clock drives the flip-flops, and the reset initializes all internal states. The filter operates synchronously with the clock, so data is processed on each rising edge of the clock.

I should also mention that the filter's cutoff frequency depends on the sampling rate, which isn't specified here but would be determined by the user based on their application.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the specification as per the user's format without any markdown or code blocks. Just plain text with each section clearly labeled.

```
1. Module Name: digital_high_pass_filter
2. Description: A digital high pass filter that processes input samples and outputs filtered samples above a specified cutoff frequency.
3. Inputs:
   - clk: 1-bit Clock signal
   - rst: 1-bit Reset signal
   - d_in: 16-bit Signed integer Input data sample
4. Outputs:
   - d_out: 16-bit Signed integer Output data sample
5. Functionality:
   The filter processes each input sample and produces an output sample based on the difference equation y[n] = x[n] - x[n-1]. This implementation uses a simple first-order high pass filter structure to attenuate low-frequency components of the input signal while allowing high-frequency components to pass through.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - Clock: Positive-edge triggered synchronous design
   - Reset: Active-high reset that initializes internal states and flip-flops
   - Filter operates synchronously with the clock signal, processing one sample per clock cycle
