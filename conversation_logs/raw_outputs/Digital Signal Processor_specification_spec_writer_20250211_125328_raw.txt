Alright, so I need to create a Verilog specification for a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). Let me break down what this entails.

First, I should figure out the module name. DSP is common, but maybe adding something like "Core" makes it clearer, so Module Name: DSP_Core.

Next, the description. A brief overview would be that it's a programmable DSP core for processing digital signals, handling tasks like filtering and modulation.

Now, inputs. I need to think about what a DSP typically receives. There's usually an input clock (clk) and a reset signal (rst). Then, data inputs: perhaps two 16-bit buses, in_a and in_b, since DSPs often handle multiply-and-accumulate operations. Also, control signals like start, load coefficients, and halt are necessary.

Outputs would include the result of processing, maybe a 32-bit out_result. There should also be status flags like done, overflow, underflow, and ready to indicate the state of processing.

For functionality, I need to outline what the DSP does step by step. It processes input samples using coefficients stored in memory. The core operations are multiply-accumulate, which is fundamental for FFTs and filters. Also, it should handle interrupt requests when done or if there's an overflow.

Timing requirements are crucial. The clock frequency (fclk) needs to be specified, say 100 MHz. Reset polarity is important—active high or low. Processing time depends on the algorithm, so I'll note that it varies but can be determined based on input length and type.

I should make sure each section is clear and structured without any markdown, just plain text with bullet points for inputs and outputs. The functionality needs to be concise yet detailed enough for implementation.

Wait, did I miss anything? Maybe the data bus widths—16 bits for in_a and in_b, 32 bits for out_result seems standard. Control signals like start, load_coeffs, halt are essential for operation control. Status flags help the system know when processing is done or if there's an issue.

I think that covers it. Now, I'll structure this into the specified format without any extra explanations.

   - clk: 1 bit Clock input  
   - rst: 1 bit Reset input  
   - in_a: 16 bits Input data A  
   - in_b: 16 bits Input data B  
   - start: 1 bit Start processing signal  
   - load_coeffs: 1 bit Load new coefficients into internal memory  
   - halt: 1 bit Halt processing signal  
4. Outputs:  
   - out_result: 32 bits Output result of processing

   The DSP_Core performs digital signal processing operations including multiplication, addition, and accumulation. It supports programmable coefficients for adaptive filtering and can handle complex algorithms such as finite impulse response (FIR) filters, infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, and FFTs. The core includes:  
   - Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit for efficient computation  
   - Coefficient memory for storing filter coefficients  
   - Data path for processing input samples  
   - Control logic for managing operations and state transitions  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock (clk): 100 MHz  
   - Reset (rst): Active high, asynchronous reset  
   - Processing time varies based on algorithm complexity and input length
