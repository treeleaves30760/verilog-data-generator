Alright, I need to create a Verilog testbench for the USB controller based on the provided specification. Let me go through the requirements step by step.

First, the testbench must include clock generation. I'll set up an always block that toggles the clock signal every 10 nanoseconds to simulate a 50 MHz clock.

Next, I need to handle the reset signal properly. The reset should be active high initially and then released after some time to allow the controller to initialize.

The USB interface has two data lines: D+ and D-. These are differential signals, so I'll need to set them appropriately for different test cases. Additionally, the VBUS power line needs to be applied after reset is released to simulate a powered USB device.

For testing all input combinations, I'll create several test cases:
1. **Enumeration Sequence**: Simulate the host pulling D+ high to initiate enumeration.
2. **Data Transfer Initiation**: Set up a scenario where data transfer starts between the controller and host.
3. **Error Conditions**: Test how the controller handles unexpected signal states.

I'll use $monitor to track the state of outputs (data_out and status) throughout the simulation. Success or failure messages will be displayed at the end based on the test results.

Finally, I'll ensure that all necessary signals are included and properly initialized in the testbench.
