2. Description: Digital PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Controller Implementation
3. Inputs:
   - setpoint: 32-bit Input representing the desired process value
   - process_value: 32-bit Input representing the actual process measurement
   - clock: 1-bit Clock signal for timing operations
   - reset_n: 1-bit Active-low asynchronous reset signal
4. Outputs:
   - control_output: 32-bit Output representing the computed control signal
5. Functionality:
   The PID controller calculates the error between the setpoint and process_value.
   It computes three terms:
   - Proportional term (Kp * error)
   - Integral term (Ki * integral of error over time)
   - Derivative term (Kd * rate of change of error)
   These terms are summed with their respective coefficients to produce the control output.
   The output is limited by saturation limits to prevent excessive actuator operation.
6. Timing Requirements:
   - clock: Standard digital clock signal
   - reset_n: Active-low asynchronous reset, used to initialize internal states and integral term to zero
