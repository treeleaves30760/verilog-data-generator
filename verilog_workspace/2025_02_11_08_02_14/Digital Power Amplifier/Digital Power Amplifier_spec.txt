2. Description: A digital power amplifier that converts a digital input signal to an analog output with adjustable volume and mute functionality, including power management features.  
3. Inputs:  
   - Clk: 1 bit (System clock)  
   - Rst_n: 1 bit (Active-low reset signal)  
   - Din: 16 bits (Digital input audio signal)  
   - Volume: 3 bits (Volume control, 0-7 levels)  
   - Mute: 1 bit (Mute control, active-high)  
   - Vdd: 1 bit (Power supply voltage)  
   - Gnd: 1 bit (Ground reference)  
4. Outputs:  
   - Dout: 1 bit (Analog output voltage)  
   - Power_Up: 1 bit (Indicates power is applied and stable)  
   - Over_Temp: 1 bit (Over-temperature alarm)  
   - Under_Voltage: 1 bit (Under-voltage detection)  
5. Functionality:  
   - Processes digital input signal to produce an amplified analog output.  
   - Implements volume control based on the Volume input.  
   - Mutes the output when Mute is active.  
   - Monitors power supply and temperature conditions, generating appropriate status signals.  
6. Timing Requirements:  
   - Clock frequency: 48 kHz (Audio sampling rate)  
   - Reset timing: Rst_n must be held low for at least two clock cycles to ensure proper initialization.  
   - Setup time: Inputs must stabilize within one clock cycle before the rising edge of Clk.  
   - Output delay: Dout and status signals should stabilize within 10 ns after valid inputs or reset release.
