Alright, I need to create a Verilog module for a 4-to-1 multiplexer based on the user's specifications. Let me break down what needs to be done.

First, I'll start by understanding the requirements. The module should have four data inputs (in0, in1, in2, in3), two control inputs (sel0 and sel1) which together form a 2-bit selector, and one output (out). The selection input determines which of the four data inputs is passed to the output.

I remember that a multiplexer can be implemented using basic logic gates. For a 4-to-1 mux, I'll need to decode the 2-bit selector into a single control signal for each input.

In Verilog, I can use a case statement or a series of if-else statements to select the correct input based on the value of sel. Using a case statement might be more efficient and readable in this scenario.

I should also consider using an always block to ensure that the output updates whenever any of the inputs change. Since the selection is based on two control bits, I'll need to use both sel0 and sel1 in the conditional statements.

Including clear comments will help others understand the functionality of each part of the module. I'll add comments explaining what each port does and how the selection logic works.

Now, putting it all together, I'll structure the module with the specified ports and implement the logic inside an always block using a case statement to select between the four inputs based on the selector bits.

```verilog
module mux_4to1 (
    input wire [1:0] sel,
    input wire in0,
    input wire in1,
    input wire in2,
    input wire in3,
    output wire out
);

    // This module selects between four inputs based on a 2-bit selector
    always @(*) begin
        case (sel)
            0:   out <= in0;  // sel == 00, select input 0
            1:   out <= in1;  // sel == 01, select input 1
            2:   out <= in2;  // sel == 10, select input 2
            default: out <= in3; // default case, select input 3 (sel == 11)
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```
