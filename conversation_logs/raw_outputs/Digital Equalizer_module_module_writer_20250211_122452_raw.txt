Alright, so I'm trying to create a Verilog module for a 2-to-1 Multiplexer based on the user's request. They provided an example of a two_to_one_mux module, and now they've given me another set of ports: input wires a, b, sel, and output reg y.

First, I need to understand what a 2-to-1 Multiplexer does. It's a digital circuit that selects between two inputs (a and b) based on the value of the selection signal (sel). If sel is 0, it should output a; if sel is 1, it should output b.

Looking at the example they provided, I see that the module uses an always @* block with a case statement. This approach seems straightforward and easy to understand. The case statement checks the value of sel and assigns y accordingly.

I need to make sure that my code follows all the guidelines mentioned:

1. **Wrap the code in ```verilog blocks**: I'll ensure that the Verilog code is properly enclosed within these blocks for formatting purposes.

2. **Provide ONLY the Verilog code**: No explanations or additional text should be included, just the code itself.

3. **Follow module name and ports from the specification exactly**: The module name should be two_to_one_mux, and the ports should match exactly as given (a, b, sel, y).

4. **Include clear comments**: I'll add comments to explain what each part of the code does, making it easier for others to understand.

5. **Use synthesizable constructs only**: The example uses case statements, which are synthesizable, so I'll stick with that approach instead of using if-else statements or other non-synthesizable constructs.

Now, putting this all together, here's how the code should look:

```verilog
module two_to_one_mux (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel,
    output reg y
);

    always @* begin
        case (sel)
            0: y = a;  // When selection is 0, output a
            default: y = b; // When selection is 1 or unknown, output b
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```

This code defines a 2-to-1 Multiplexer with the specified ports. The always @* block ensures that the case statement is evaluated whenever any of the inputs change. The comments explain the functionality clearly, and the use of case statements makes it synthesizable.

I think this meets all the requirements set forth by the user. It's efficient, correct, and follows their guidelines precisely.

```verilog
module two_to_one_mux (
    input wire a,
    input wire b,
    input wire sel,
    output reg y
);

    always @* begin
        case (sel)
            0: y = a;  // When selection is 0, output a
            default: y = b; // When selection is 1 or unknown, output b
        endcase
    end

endmodule
```
